1.  Spread density function constant is one of the factors that determines the relative weighting of orders by spread, i.e., the amount of additional rewards for orders with tighter spreads vs those with wider spreads. Refer to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mUZsQoiqlMs5HjcL6AXSKIx1oaULsmuQStJaCc2wggQ/edit?ts=5f1e89bd#gid=18167917) for the spread weights and for a visual of the graph that shows the curve.

2.  The HARD Protocol liquidity mining campaign will distribute 10,000 USDT rewards in the first week alone, and USDT 30,000 in total over 12 weeks. Refer to this [blog post](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2020-11-kava-liquidity-mining-campaign/) for the reward allocation for the 2nd week to 12th week.

## Upcoming Changes to Terms

No upcoming change in terms

## Additional liquidity mining campaign terms

Qualified participants will be eligible to receive compensation in accordance with each liquidity mining campaign’s schedule of Liquidity Mining Payments, which will be based on each participant’s trading activity (in particular, orders placed and their sizes and spreads) in the tokens subject to the liquidity mining campaign.

**Wallet address**  
Participants must enter a valid wallet address applicable for the campaign that they are participating in. Wallet address are use for receiving payouts only, you do not need deposit assets into or trade using this wallet.  
For more details on how to obtain wallet address and its requiremets, please refer to our docs on [Liquidity Mining FAQs](/resources/liquidity-mining/)

> **Warning:** CoinAlpha does not take any responsibility and will not reimburse for any loss of funds due to a participant submitting an incorrect or invalid wallet address.

> **Important:** Orders outstanding for more than 30 minutes not counted for rewards

Work on removing this limit is in progress, you can read more about it in our [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hummingbot/comments/hz5xv3/tracking_rewards_for_orders_longer_than_30m/).

> **Tip:** To ensure that orders do not stay outstanding for longer than 30 minutes, Hummingbot users should disable [order refresh tolerance](/strategies/order-refresh-tolerance/).

**Minimum reward payout amount**

Due to the recent surge in Ethereum gas price, Hummingbot will impose a $50.00 minimum on the weekly payout **for payments on the Ethereum blockchain (currently USDT and RLC)**, starting with the next scheduled payout on September 18th (UTC).

>**Note:** This limit is only for campaigns paying in USDT (but not including Algorand which pays USDT ASA), and for anyone who hasn't entered a Tron wallet.

For miners who earn < $50 within one week, their rewards will be accrued and rolled over to the next period, read more in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hummingbot/comments/ip4mc3/announcement_raising_minimum_payment_to_50/).

## What is "liquidity mining"?

Liquidity mining is a community-based, data-driven approach to market making, in which a token issuer or exchange can reward a pool of miners to provide liquidity for a specified token.

Liquidity mining sets forth an analytical framework for determining market maker compensation based on (1) time (order book consistency), (2) order spreads, and (3) order sizes, in order to create a fair model for compensation that aligns a miner's risk with rewards.
