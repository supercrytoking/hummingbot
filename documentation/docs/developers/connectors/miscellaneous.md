## Adding Connectors to Exchanges on Other Blockchains

Hummingbot currently has connectors to Ethereum-based exchanges and has built in [Ethereum wallet support](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/wallet/ethereum).

We plan to support multiple blockchains in the near future. To support blockchains other than Ethereum, connectors for new blockchains other than Ethereum would require integrations that enables the following blockchain-specific functionalities:

- interactions with blockchain wallets: import, creation, encryption
- interactions with blockchain nodes
- interactions with event watchers: balances, token address mappings, contract events, token events,
- interaction with blockchain-based exchanges
