# Task 1 â€” OrderBookTracker & Data Source

![OrderBookTrackerUMLDiagram](/assets/img/order-book-tracker-architecture.svg)

The **_UML Diagram_**, given above, illustrates the relations between `OrderBookTracker` and its subsidiary classes.

!!! warning
    Attributes and functions for **Perpetual** connectors are marked above in red.

The first components to implement are as follows:

- `OrderBookTracker`
- `OrderBookTrackerDataSource`
- `OrderBook`
- `OrderBookMessage`

## OrderBookTracker

The `OrderBookTracker` contains subsidiary classes that help maintain the real-time order book of a market.
Namely, the classes are `OrderBookTrackerDataSource`, `OrderBook` and `OrderBookMessage`.

Integrating a new exchange connector requires you to extend from the `OrderBookTracker` base class [here](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/core/data_type/order_book_tracker.py)


!!! note
    The functions mentioned below will have to be adequately adjusted based on the data provided by the exchange API. Using `metadata` to include additional information into `content` might be useful if data(i.e. `update_id`, `timestamp`) is not provided by the exchanges API.

The following details are **required** functions to be implemented in `OrderBookTracker`:

### `exchange_name`

This function returns the appropriate exchange name

**Input Parameter(s):** `None` <br/> **Expected Output(s):** `str`

### `is_funding_info_initialized`

This function is only needed for **Perpetual** connectors. It returns `True` if the funding information has been successfully initialized by `OrderBookTrackerDataSource`.

**Input Parameter(s):** `None` <br/> **Expected Output(s):** `bool`

## OrderBookTrackerDataSource

The `OrderBookTrackerDataSource` class is responsible for making API calls and/or WebSocket queries to obtain order book snapshots, order book deltas, public order book trades and miscellaneous information on the order book.

Integrating your data source component requires you to extend from the `OrderBookTrackerDataSource` base class [here](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/core/data_type/order_book_tracker_data_source.py).

The following details the **required** functions in `OrderBookTrackerDataSource`:

### `fetch_trading_pairs`

Performs the necessary API request(s) to get all the active trading pairs being traded on the exchange.
It is also expected that the trading pairs are converted into Hummingbot's `BaseAsset-QuoteAsset` format (i.e. `ETH-USDT`)

**Input Parameter(s):** `None` <br/> **Expected Output(s):** `Dict[str, float]`

### `get_last_traded_prices`

Performs the necessary API request(s) to get the last traded price for the given markets (trading_pairs) and return a dictionary of `trading_pair` its last traded price.

**Input Parameter(s):** trading_pairs: `List[str]`<br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Dict[str, float]`

### `get_snapshot`

Fetches order book snapshot for a particular trading pair from the exchange REST API.<br/>

!!! note
    Certain exchanges do not add a timestamp/nonce to the snapshot response. In this case, to maintain a real-time order book would require generating a timestamp for every order book snapshot and delta messages received and applying them accordingly. In the [Bittrex connector](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector), this is performed by invoking the `queryExchangeState` topic on the SignalR WebSocket client.

**Input Parameter(s):** client: `aiohttp.ClientSession`, trading_pair: `str` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `Dict[str, any]`

### `get_new_order_book`

Create a new `OrderBook` instance and populate its `bids` and `asks` by applying the orderbook snapshot to the order book by calling the `snapshot_message_from_exchange` function defined in the `OrderBook` class.

**Input Parameter:** trading_pair: `str` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `OrderBook`

!!! note
    Certain exchanges do not add a timestamp/nonce to the snapshot response. In this case, to maintain a real-time order book would require generating a timestamp for every order book snapshot and delta messages received and applying them accordingly. In the [Bittrex connector](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector), this is performed by invoking the `queryExchangeState` topic on the SignalR WebSocket client.

### `get_funding_info`

This function is only needed for **Perpetual** connectors. It returns the FundingInfo of the specified trading pair. If it does not exist, it will schedule a REST API query to make the information available on future function calls.

!!! note
    The FundingInfo for the active trading pair is maintained by the `listen_for_instruments_info` task.

**Input Parameter:** trading_pair: `str` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `FundingInfo`

### `listen_for_subscriptions`

Subscribes to all required public channels; namely, orderbook depth, orderbook trades and funding information (only for Perpetual Connectors) and starts the listening cycle. Responsible for the adding the messages to corresponding `asyncio.Queue`.

**Input Parameter:** None <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

### `listen_for_trades`

Retrieves the trade messages from the `_message_queue` and adds them to the `output` queue, to be processed by `OrderBookTracker` (in `_emit_trade_event_loop`). Additionally, parses the incoming message into an `OrderBookMessage`(using `OrderBook.trade_message_from_exchange()`) and appends it into the `output` Queue.

**Input Parameter:** ev_loop: `asyncio.BaseEventLoop`, output: `asyncio.Queue` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

### `listen_for_order_book_diffs`

Retrieves the orderbook depth messages from the `_message_queue` and adds them to the `output` queue. Additionally, parses the incoming message into an `OrderBookMessage`(using `OrderBook.diff_message_from_exchange()`) and appends it into the `output` Queue.

**Input Parameter:** ev_loop: `asyncio.BaseEventLoop`, output: `asyncio.Queue` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

!!! note
    In some cases, the exchange's orderbook depth channel initially returns an orderbook snapshot, it should be parsed accordingly using the `OrderBook.snapshot_message_from_exchange`.

### `listen_for_order_book_snapshots`

Periodically fetches (using the REST API) and parses the response into an `OrderBookMessage` and appends it into the `output` Queue.

**Input Parameter:** ev_loop: `asyncio.BaseEventLoop`, output: `asyncio.Queue` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

!!! note
    `listen_for_subscriptions` is the primary function responsible for retrieving the orderbook depth and trades. While `listen_for_trades/order_book_diffs` simply parses and queues the messages. 

### `listen_for_funding_info`

Only needed for **Perpetual** connectors. Retrieves the symbol update messages from the `_message_queue` and adds it to the `output` queue. Additionally, parses the incoming messages and updates the attribute `_funding_info` with an updated `FundingInfo` data object. It should reflect the changes in index price, mark price, next funding timestamp and predicted funding rate.

**Input Parameter:** ev_loop: `asyncio.BaseEventLoop`, output: `asyncio.Queue` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** None

!!! note
    See [here](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/core/data_type/funding_info.py) for reference to the `FundingInfo` data object.


## OrderBook

The `OrderBook` is an interface class that contains all the necessary functions and variables to maintain an order book of the specified trading pair.
Implementing an exchange connector requires its own order book class that extends from the `OrderBook`.

The following details are **required** functions to be implemented in the new `OrderBook` class:

### `snapshot_message_from_exchange`

Converts json snapshot data from the exchange into standard `OrderBookMessage` format. 

**Input Parameter(s):** msg: `Dict[str, any]`, timestamp: `float`, metadata: `Optional[Dict] = None` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `OrderBookMessage`

### `diff_message_from_exchange`

Converts json diff data from the exchange into standard `OrderBookMessage` format.

**Input Parameter(s):** msg: `Dict[str, any]`, timestamp: `float`, metadata: `Optional[Dict] = None` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `OrderBookMessage`

!!! warning
    Include `update_id` as part of `content` in the `OrderBookMessage` of both snapshot and diff messages. `update_id` should be an incrementally increasing integer that indicates the sequence in which the diff should be applied to the order book. See [`OrderBookMessage`](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/core/data_type/order_book_message.py#L38-L42)

### `trade_message_from_exchange`

Converts json trade data from the exchange into standard `OrderBookMessage` format.

**Input Parameter(s):** msg: `Dict[str, any]`, timestamp: `float`, metadata: `Optional[Dict] = None` <br/>
**Expected Output(s):** `OrderBookMessage`

!!! warning
    Include `update_id` as part of `content` in the `OrderBookMessage` of both snapshot and diff messages. `update_id` should be an incrementally increasing integer that indicates the sequence in which the diff should be applied to the order book. See [`OrderBookMessage`](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/core/data_type/order_book_message.py#L38-L42)


## OrderBookMessage

The `OrderBookMessage` is an abstract class that stores the relevant order book information obtained from either the exchange or a local db.
Integrating a new exchange connector will require implementing its own class that extends from `OrderBookMessage`.

The `OrderBookMessage` base class contains 3 main attributes, namely:

- type: `OrderBookMessageType`<br/>
  Specified and differentiate the messages from `SNAPSHOT`, `DIFF` and `TRADE` types.

- content: `Dict[str, any]`<br/>
  Contains the API response for snapshot, diff and trades in a JSON format.

- timestamp: `float`<br/>
  Defines the time in which the message is received.

The following details are **required** functions to be implemented in the new `OrderBookMessage` class:

### `update_id`

Only relevant for `OrderBookMessageType.DIFF` and `OrderBookMessageType.SNAPSHOT` messages.
This id is either the timestamp or the sequential nonce of the message.

### `trade_id`

Only relevant for `OrderBookMessageType.TRADE` messages. This id is either the trade id itself or the timestamp of the message.

### `trading_pair`

Specifies the trading pair in which this order book message is associated to.

### `asks`

Only relevant for `OrderBookMessageType.DIFF` and `OrderBookMessageType.SNAPSHOT` messages.
List of all the order book entries on the ask side.

### `bids`

Only relevant for `OrderBookMessageType.DIFF` and `OrderBookMessageType.SNAPSHOT` messages.
List of all the order book entries on the bid side.

## Utility Functions

It contains any miscellaneous functions that are not completely associated with the classes defined in the overall architecture but necessary for Hummingbot to perform its functions adequately.
These are stored in the `*_utils.py` file.

Below are some examples of such functions:

| Function(s)                                    | Description                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `convert_snapshot_message_to_order_book_row()` | Performs the necessary conversion from `OrderBookMessage` to a `Tuplep[List[OrderBookRow]]`                     |
| `get_new_client_order_id()`                    | Generates a Hummingbot client order id from which it does its own tracking.                                     |
| `convert_from_exchange_trading_pair()`         | Converts the exchange's trading pair to `[Base]-[Quote]` formats and return the output.                         |
| `convert_to_exchange_trading_pair()`           | Converts HB's `[Base]-[Quote]` trading pair format to the exchange's trading pair format and return the output. |

!!! note
    The `convert_from/to_exchange_trading_pair()` functions are only required if the exchange does not provide trading pairs in `Base-Quote` format.
