# Developer Quickstart â€“ Windows

This guide walks you through how to prepare your development environment and get started developing for Hummingbot.

Below, we list what you'll need before you install and run Hummingbot.

## System Requirements

**Why this is needed**: If you are installing Hummingbot either locally or on a cloud server, here are the recommended minimum system requirements:

- Windows 10 or later

For more information, view [minimum system requirements](/installation/#minimum-system-requirements).

## Software Requirements

**Why this is needed**: For Hummingbot development on Windows, you'll need ***one*** of the following installed:

- Linux VM
- Windows Subsystem for Linux

For more information, view [installing Hummingbot](/developers/gettingstarted/windows/1-installing).

## Cloud Server (Optional)

We recommend that users run trading bots in the cloud, since bots require a stable network connection and can run 24/7.

Follow the guide to [set up a cloud server](/installation/cloud) on your preferred cloud platform. Hummingbot is not resource-intensive so the lowest/free tiers should work.

!!! tip
    Don't know which cloud platform to use? Read our [blog post](https://www.hummingbot.io/blog/2019-06-cloud-providers/) that compares and contrasts the different providers.

If you just want to test out Hummingbot, you can skip this and install locally.
