## Tutorial: Creating Custom Strategies (WIP)

We are working with a students from Cornell University's [open source software engineering class](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5152/2017sp/) to create a step-by-step guide that shows developers how to write custom algorithmic trading strategies using Hummingbot. 

The tutorial will be a hands-on guide that builds up to creating TWAP and VWAP algorithmic execution bots. It is currently work-in-progress but you can check out the initial parts [here](/developers/tutorial).
