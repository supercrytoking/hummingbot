# Using Ethereum Nodes

You need an Ethereum node for strategies that trade on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges, such as Radar Relay, Bamboo Relay, and Dolomite.

Selecting one of these exchanges will prompt the following question during the configuration process:

```
Which Ethereum node would you like your client to connect to? >>>
```

Below, we list different ways that you can access an Ethereum node.

## Option 1. Infura
[Infura](https://infura.io/) provides free and the most widely used Ethereum nodes.

!!! note "Important for Infura users"
    If you use an Infura endpoint, make sure to append `https://` to the URL when you use it in Hummingbot. Otherwise, you may see a `Bad ethereum rpc url` error.

## Option 2. Run your own local node

The most decentralized way to access an Ethereum node is to run your own node!

Running your own node may require dedicated storage and compute, as well as some technical skills. These are the two most widely used Ethereum clients:

- [Geth (go-ethereum)](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum)
- [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum)

!!! note
    These may require several hours to days to sync and may require some troubleshooting when first running.

## Option 3. Dedicated blockchain hardware
Get dedicated hardware for your Ethereum node.  Ethereum nodes are meant to run constantly 24/7 and use up a material amount of computational resources (CPU, RAM, and storage).  For more serious users, it may make sense to use dedicated hardware.

### Software
- [DAppNode](https://dappnode.io/) is software that automates the installation and operation of Ethereum (as well as other blockchains) on dedicated hardware.it easier to start and operate an Ethereum node and can run other blockchains.

### Hardware
- [Intelâ“‡ NUC mini PC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html): DIY, customize and configure your own hardware.
- [Avado](https://ava.do/): purpose built hardware that is pre-loaded with DAppNode.
