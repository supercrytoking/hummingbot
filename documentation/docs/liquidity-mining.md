## Overview
Liquidity mining is a community-based, data-driven approach to market making, in which a token issuer or exchange can reward a pool of miners to provide liquidity for a specified token.

Liquidity mining sets forth an analytical framework for determining market maker compensation based on (1) time (order book consistency), (2) order spreads, and (3) order sizes, in order to create a fair model for compensation that aligns a miner's risk with rewards.

## Key dates

During the **open beta**, we track real exchange order books for real user-submitted orders, but we pay testnet Ethereum token rewards (no value). After the commencement of **production launch**, we will pay mainnet Ethereum token rewards.

* **Open beta**: 12:00am February 4, 2020 UTC time
* **Production launch**: *(subject to change)* 12:00am March 3, 2020 UTC time

## Hummingbot Miner

[Hummingbot Miner](https://miners.hummingbot.io/) is the **official Liquidity Mining app** where users can get real-time information on liquidity mining campaigns.

Use Hummingbot Miner to sign up for liquidity mining, connect the app to your exchange accounts to enable rewards, and track your liquidity mining activity and earnings. **Note that you will still need to run Hummingbot or another market making bot in order to earn liquidity mining rewards.**

!!! note "Mobile support"
    Currently, Hummingbot Miner is only optimized for desktop/laptop devices. We plan to add mobile/tablet support shortly.

### What are the tabs on the dashboard?

Tab | Description
---|---
**Markets** | Displays the currently available liquidity mining campaigns: eligible token pairs, exchanges, and recent participation and reward metrics
**Activity** | Displays a miner's currently accrued rewards, recent history of rewards earned, as well as payout history.
**Settings** | Configuration tab for setting up exchange APIs to enable participation in liquidity mining campaigns.

### What do the figures on the Markets tab mean?

The figures on the Markets tab show a summary of aggregated data across all campaigns and across all miners, as well as aggregated data for each token pair.

### Why do I need to connect my wallet?

<small><em>Note: figures above are for illustration only and do not represent current campaign terms; navigate to [Hummingbot Miners](https://miners.hummingbot.io) for current campaign details.</em></small>

The Hummingbot Miners app uses your Ethereum wallet address for:

1. **assigning you a unique user ID**.  The Hummingbot miners app associates your configurations (e.g. email address, API configurations), as well as activity.  This allows the miners app to display your user-specific information such as rewards earned and payout history.
2. **payouts**: mining rewards payouts will be sent to this address

!!! note "Wallet not used for trading"
    Since it is only used for the purposes mentioned above, you do not need deposit assets into or trade using this wallet.

## Harmony

[Harmony (ONE)](https://harmony.one/) is a new a base-layer blockchain project with key innovations in state sharding and peer-to-peer networking. Its sharding technology uses secure proof-of-stake and decentralized randomness, and its networking technology achieves optimal cross-shard routing and fask block propagation. Harmony is set on a mission to scale trust for billions of people and power decentralized economies. 

Partnering with Harmony, we launched a successful pilot program rewarding community members for running market making bots for $ONE using Hummingbot in 2019.

## 0x

[0x](https://0x.org/) is an open protocol that enables peer-to-peer exchange of assets on the Ethereum blockchain.

They are sponsoring a campaign for WETH/DAI on [Bamboo Relay](https://bamboorelay.com/), a decentralized crypto exchange built on 0x protocol. Users can trade, lend or borrow any ERC20 token trustlessly from their own wallet.

## iExec

[iExec (RLC)](https://iex.ec/) claims to have developed the first decentralized marketplace for cloud computing resources. Blockchain technology is used to organize a market network where users can monetize their computing power, applications, and datasets. By providing on-demand access to cloud computing resources, iExec is reportedly able to support compute-intensive applications in fields such as AI, big data, healthcare, rendering, or FinTech. iExec's RLC token has been listed on Binance, Bittrex, etc.

## Zcoin

[ZCoin (XZC)](https://zcoin.io/) is an open-source privacy-focused cryptocurrency token that launched in Sep 2016. Zcoin originally pioneered the use of Zerocoin to enable privacy but has since transitioned to a scheme called Sigma which is based on a paper by Jens Groth and Markulf Kohlweiss that reportedly allows greater scalability and removes the need for trusted setup in Zerocoin. With Zcoin’s Sigma feature, only the sender and receiver would be able to ascertain the exchange of funds in a given transaction, as no transaction histories are linked to the actual coins. Zcoin is also the creator of the Lelantus privacy protocol which improves Sigma's privacy and functionality. Its ZC token has been listed on Binance, Huobi Global, Bittrex, etc.

## Zilliqa

[Zilliqa (ZIL)](https://zilliqa.com/) is a base-layer blockchain protocol centered around the idea of 'Sharding' and designed to enhance the scalability of cryptocurrency networks such as Ethereum. According to its white paper, transactions speed could scale to approximately 1,000x that of Ethereum's network. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that developers can focus on fleshing out their ideas rather than worrying about network congestion.
