## What is it?
Liquidity mining is a community-based, data-driven approach to market making, in which a token issuer or exchange can reward a pool of miners to provide liquidity for a specified token.

Liquidity mining sets forth an analytical framework for determining market maker compensation based on (1) time (order book consistency), (2) order spreads, and (3) order sizes, in order to create a fair model for compensation that aligns a miner's risk with rewards.

### Harmony

[Harmony (ONE)](https://harmony.one/) is a new a base-layer blockchain project with key innovations in state sharding and peer-to-peer networking. Its sharding technology uses secure proof-of-stake and decentralized randomness, and its networking technology achieves optimal cross-shard routing and fask block propagation. Harmony is set on a mission to scale trust for billions of people and power decentralized economies. 

Partnering with Harmony, we launched a successful pilot program rewarding community members for running market making bots for $ONE using Hummingbot in 2019.

### iExec

[iExec (RLC)](https://iex.ec/) claims to have developed the first decentralized marketplace for cloud computing resources. Blockchain technology is used to organize a market network where users can monetize their computing power, applications, and datasets. By providing on-demand access to cloud computing resources, iExec is reportedly able to support compute-intensive applications in fields such as AI, big data, healthcare, rendering, or FinTech. iExec's RLC token has been listed on Binance, Bittrex, etc.

### Zcoin

[ZCoin (XZC)](https://zcoin.io/) is an open-source privacy-focused cryptocurrency token that launched in Sep 2016. Zcoin originally pioneered the use of Zerocoin to enable privacy but has since transitioned to a scheme called Sigma which is based on a paper by Jens Groth and Markulf Kohlweiss that reportedly allows greater scalability and removes the need for trusted setup in Zerocoin. With Zcoin’s Sigma feature, only the sender and receiver would be able to ascertain the exchange of funds in a given transaction, as no transaction histories are linked to the actual coins. Zcoin is also the creator of the Lelantus privacy protocol which improves Sigma's privacy and functionality. Its ZC token has been listed on Binance, Huobi Global, Bittrex, etc.

### Zilliqa

[Zilliqa (ZIL)](https://zilliqa.com/) is a base-layer blockchain protocol centered around the idea of 'Sharding' and designed to enhance the scalability of cryptocurrency networks such as Ethereum. According to its white paper, transactions speed could scale to approximately 1,000x that of Ethereum's network. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that developers can focus on fleshing out their ideas rather than worrying about network congestion.
