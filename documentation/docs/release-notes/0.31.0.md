# Release Notes - Version 0.31.0

## üíª Developers Updates

### Connector Change Summary

* Added a new `ExchangeBase` class to replace `MarketBase`.
* Removed `OrderBookTrackerDataSourceType` and `UserStreamTrackerDataSourceType` from connector.
* Added `_real_time_balance_update` to `ExchangeBase`, set this to `True` if your connector doesn't provide account balance 
update via web socket API, you will also need to set `_in_flight_orders_snapshot` and `_in_flight_orders_snapshot_timestamp` 
during balance update.
* Moved exchange connectors to a new location: [hummingbot/connector/exchange](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/development/hummingbot/connector/exchange)
* Formalize trading pair format, except within the connector module, all trading pairs are in BASE-QUOTE format.
* Remove market argument on `InFlightOrderBase` (it was never used for anything).
