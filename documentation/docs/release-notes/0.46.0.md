## Discontinue Binary Support

In this release, we added a package dependency required for improving Avellaneda Market Making strategy and for its calculations to work correctly. This change is incompatible with Windows operating system which caused issues building the binary installer or the strategy not being usable.

Currently, `loopring` and `dydx_perpetual` connectors as well as `amm_arbitrage` strategy, do not work with binary versions and we have encountered other similar issues in previous releases caused by these incompatibilities. After this release, we will deprecate and no longer support binary versions.

New users who want to test and try out Hummingbot can launch an instance of our Test Drive from https://hummingbot.io/en/test-drive/.


## Reworked Paper Trade Mode

Paper trading now only supports Binance, KuCoin, AscendEX, and Gate.io exchange. The main objective of paper trade mode is to allow new users to test and familiarize themselves with Hummingbot's [basic operations](/operation) (e.g. creating / importing a strategy, checking available balances, checking bot status, etc.) before risking real assets.

As our codebase grows, the current design will not be able to support all strategies and connectors. Several exchanges also do not provide endpoints that we require for a paper trade bot's performance to be the same as actual trading.

To enable paper trading, users will now have to select paper trade exchanges when configuring a strategy. Read more about [Paper Trade](/global-configs/paper-trade) in our documentation.


## Improved Avellaneda Market Making (Part 1)

We are making improvements to the initial implementation of the Avellenada-Stoikov strategy. In this release, we fixed the greek parameters `gamma` (risk factor), `eta` (shape factor), and `kappa` (liquidity factor) to use the calculation of its original design.

Some advanced parameters were added and we removed those that were not a requirement for the strategy to behave correctly. The updated list of parameters can be found in [Avellaneda Market Making](/strategies/avellaneda-market-making/#strategy-configs) documentation.

In the next release, we will rework the time factor to allow an infinite time horizon as described in Github issue [#4650](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/4650).


## Simplified Perpetual Market Making

The strategy is now written in pure Python code to make it easier for developers in our community to debug and build on top of its code for future enhancements. We also removed some rarely used advanced parameters (or not used at all) inherited from Pure Market Making that were not required for this strategy to run.

Some other changes and improvements are:

- Changed to `LIMIT` order type to allow taker orders when crossing the order book
- Profit taking is always on by default instead of having a trailing stop loss feature
- Added a stop loss order retry logic
- Unit tests were added to cover the entire strategy

More detailed information on these changes can be found in Github issue [#4565](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/issues/4565) and updated [Perpetual Market Making](/strategies/perpetual-market-making) documentation.
