# Release Notes - Version 0.17.0

üöÄ Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.17.0! This release includes the launch of Bittrex connector, developer documentation for custom strategies, and update to portfolio performance calculation. We also continued on addressing reported bugs.


## üîó New Bittrex connector

Hummingbot now supports [Bittrex International](https://international.bittrex.com/)! Bittrex is a global, centralized cryptocurrency exchange based in Seattle, USA. It is an intuitive and easy to navigate exchange platform often finding its way into the top 3 US exchanges in terms of trading volume.

Read more how to use Bittrex connector with Hummingbot in the [User Manual](https://docs.hummingbot.io/connectors/bittrex/).


## üìä New performance analysis calculation

We redesigned how Hummingbot analyzes performance so that deposits, withdrawals, manual trades does not affect calculation and percentage profit is only based on assets spent and acquired in trades. Refer to our []() for more information.


## üìù More developer documentation

Developer tutorial on building custom strategies and documentation for **Perform Trade** strategy have been published.

* AWS free tier provides 7.7GB of disk space. Ubuntu files take about 1.1 GB, Docker takes about 0.4 GB, and hummingbot image takes about 2.5 GB. This leaves about 3.7 GB for the logs and data files, which should be enough, especially now that we have set up log rotation.
