# Release Notes - Version 0.20.0

🚀 Welcome to `hummingbot` version 0.20.0! In this release, we mainly addressed a number of bugs. Separately from the `hummingbot` client, the team has been hard at work on the Liquidity Mining infrastructure, with campaigns on target for a mid-January launch.

## 🌊⛏️ Liquidity mining update

In mid January 2020, we plan to launch liquidity mining campaigns for our launch partners on 0x Mesh and Binance. There will be approximately US \$3,000-$8,000 per month in rewards for liquidity miners to earn in each campaign.

Also, we recently released a blog explaining how liquidity mining rewards are calculated on our new platform. For more information, read through our blog posts:

* [Liquidity Mining Launch Update](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2019-12-liquidity-mining-launch/) 
* [Demystifying Liquidity Mining Rewards](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2019-12-liquidity-mining-rewards/))

## 🔗Connectors update

* We made significant progress on the Liquid.com and Bitcoin.com Exchange connectors, completing up to [task 3](/developers/connectors/tutorial/#task-3-market-connector) for each connector and merging them into the code.
* Both connectors are substantially completed, with the only remaining task being [task 4](/developers/connectors/tutorial/#task-4-hummingbot-client) as well as testing.  We expect both connectors to be merged into the `development` branch soon, and to be included in the next 0.21.0 release.

## 🤓 Developer usability

* Added explanation in developer documentation for being specific when auto-completing exchange names. Read more in [config definition conventions](https://docs.hummingbot.io/developers/config/#config-definition-conventions).
