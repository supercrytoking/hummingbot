## Reduce number of Ethereum node calls

Refactored block watchers and web3 wallet modules to materially reduce the number of required interactions with the Ethereum node.

## Developer usablity

As part of our ongoing efforts to make the Hummingbog code base more understandable and usable for developers, 0.13.0 includes quite a bit of new explanations / documentation:

* Developer documentation for [cross exchange market making](/developers/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/).
* Added in code commenting for arbitrage, cross exchange market making, and discovery strategy code.

## 💻 Autostart a strategy on launch with new CLI launch commands

Hummingbot now allows you to launch Hummingbot and automatically start a previously configured strategy without requiring `config` and `start` to be run in the Hummingbot clients.  Users can now specify the strategy, config file, and wallet details (if required for DEX trading) when launching Hummingbot, allowing for the strategy to auto-start.

For more details, see here: [trading strategy autostart](/operation/client/#trading-strategy-autostart).

## Add use of API key for IDEX connector

On Friday August 23, IDEX released updates to its servers requiring authentication/use of API keys to access its APIs.  For more information, see [IDEX API key](/connectors/idex/#api-key).
