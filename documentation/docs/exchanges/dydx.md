## üîë Connection

Since this exchange is an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX), first run `connect ethereum` in order to connect your Ethereum wallet. See [Ethereum](/protocols/ethereum) for more information. Then, go to dYdX and create API keys for the same Ethereum wallet.

Next, run `connect dydx` in Hummingbot in order to add your API keys.

## ü™ô Fees

Hummingbot assumes 0.0% maker fees and 0.3% taker fees ([source](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector/exchange/dydx/dydx_utils.py#L11)).

Users can override these assumptions with [Override Fees](/global-configs/override-fees/).
