# [Quickstart] Setup

This guide walks you through how to install Hummingbot and run your first trading bot.

Below, we list what you'll need before you install and run Hummingbot.

## System Requirements

**Why this is needed**: If you are installing Hummingbot either locally or on a cloud server, here are the recommended minimum system requirements:

- (Linux) Ubuntu 16.04 or later
- (Mac) macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later
- (Windows) Windows 10 or later

For more information, view [minimum system requirements](/installation/#minimum-system-requirements).

## Crypto Inventory

**Why this is needed**: In order to run trading bot, you'll need some inventory of crypto assets available on the exchange, or in your Ethereum wallet (for Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges).

Remember that you need inventory of both the **base asset** (the asset that you are buying and selling) and the **quote asset** (the asset that you exchange for it). For example, if you are making a market in a `BTC/USDT` trading pair, you'll need some `BTC` and `USDT`.

In addition, be aware of the minimum order size requirements on different exchanges. For more information, please see [Connectors](/connectors).

## API Keys

**Why this is needed**: 

- To run a bot on a **centralized exchange** like Binance or Huobi, you will need to enter the exchange API keys during the Hummingbot configuration process. For more information, please see [API Keys](/installation/api-keys).

## Ethereum Wallet and Node

**Why this is needed**: 

- If you plan to run bots on **decentralized exchanges** like Radar Relay, you will need an Ethereum wallet and access to an Ethereum node. For more information, see [Ethereum wallet](/installation/wallet) and [Ethereum node](/installation/node/).
