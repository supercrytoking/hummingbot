# [Quickstart Guide] Before you begin
This guide shows you how to install Hummingbot, register to earn rewards, and run your first trading bot.

Below, we list what you'll need before you install and run Hummingbot.

## System Requirements

**Why this is needed**: If you are installing Hummingbot on your local machine or on a cloud server, here are the recommended minimum system requirements.

- (Linux) Ubuntu 16.04 or later
- (Mac) macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later
- (Windows) Windows 10 or later

## Inventory of Digital Assets

**Why this is needed**: In order to run a market making or arbitrage bots, you'll need some inventory of digital assets. The assets should be deposited on a centralized exchange, or in your Ethereum wallet for trading on decentralized exchanges.


You need inventory of both the **base asset** (the asset that you are buying and selling) and the **quote asset** (the asset that you exchange for it).

For example, if you are making a market in the `BTC/USDT` trading pair on Binance, you'll need some `BTC` and `USDT`. In addition, be aware of the minimum order size requirements on different exchanges.

## Exchange API Keys
In order to trade on a centralized exchange such as Binance, you will need to import its API keys into Hummingbot.

For more information, please see [API Keys](/installation/api-keys).

## Ethereum Wallet
Since bounty rewards are distributed to your Ethereum wallet, you'll need to enter your wallet's public address when you register. In addition, participants must maintain a balance of at least 0.1 ETH to be eligible to earn bounties. This mitigates the risk of spam attacks and ensures that everyone has a fair chances to earn the bounties.

For more information on creating or importing a wallet, see [Ethereum wallet](/installation/wallet).
