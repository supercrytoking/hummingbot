## What you'll need

### System Requirements

If you are installing Hummingbot either locally or on a cloud server, here are the recommended minimum system requirements:

* Linux: Ubuntu 16.04 or later
* MacOS: macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later
* Windows: Windows 10 or later

<!-- ### Inventory

Hummingbot is trading software that uses your own crypto assets. You will need inventory available on each exchange where you want to run a bot.

Remember that you need inventory of both the **base asset** (the asset that you are buying and selling) and the **quote asset** (the asset that you exchange for it). For example, if you are making a market in a `BTC/USDT` trading pair, you'll need some `BTC` and `USDT`. -->

### API Keys

To grant Hummingbot access to your assets, you will need to enter the exchange API keys during the Hummingbot configuration process. 

See [API Keys](/installation/api-keys) for instructions on creating API keys for each supported exchange.
