# Trading Glossary

Market making, along with algorithmic trading generally, entails specific terminology. We define some of the most commonly used terms below.

| **base currency** | The currency in a currency pair whose quantity is fixed as a single unit in a price quote.<br/><br/>*For example, in a price quotation of ETH/DAI 100, ETH is the base currency and 100 is the amount of DAI exchangeable for each unit of ETH.*
| **centralized exchange (“CEX”)** | An exchange which is operated by a central authority.  In addition to order matching and broadcasting, the centralized exchange keeps custody of users’ assets.
| **decentralized exchange (“DEX”)** | An exchange which is operates in a decentralized way, using smart contracts to facilitate the transacting in and settling of assets. Generally, one distinguishing feature of a decentralized exchange is that participants keep custody of their own assets in their own wallets; the DEX facilitates the direct wallet-to-wallet settlement between counterparties in a transaction.
| **maker** | A party that places _maker orders_, and in doing so, provides liquidity to the market.
| **maker order** | A “limit order”; which is an order to buy or sell an asset at a specified price and quantity.  Execution of this order is not guaranteed; the order is only filled if there is a taker that accepts the price and quantity and transacts.
| **order book** | A list of currently available (maker) orders on an exchange, showing all of the current buyer and seller interest in an asset.
| **quote currency** | The currency in a currency pair whose quantity varies and whose quantity is denoted by the numerical figure of the price quote.<br/><br/>*For example, in a price quotation of ETH/DAI 100, DAI is the quote currency and 100 units of DAI are referenced in this exchange.*
| **taker** | A party that places _taker orders_, which execute immediately and fill a maker order.
| **taker order** | A “market order”; an order to buy or sell a specified quantity of an asset which is filled immediately at the best available price(s) available on the exchange.
