# Common 'How To' Questions

Frequently asked 'how-to' questions and problems that may arise when using Hummingbot.

#### How do I find out where the config and log files are on my local computer?

Run the following command to view the details of your instance:

```bash
docker inspect $instance_name
```

Look for a field `Mounts`, which will describe where the folders are on you local machine:

```
"Mounts": [
    {
        "Type": "bind",
        "Source": "/home/ubuntu/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_conf",
        "Destination": "/conf",
        "Mode": "",
        "RW": true,
        "Propagation": "rprivate"
    },
    {
        "Type": "bind",
        "Source": "/home/ubuntu/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_logs",
        "Destination": "/logs",
        "Mode": "",
        "RW": true,
        "Propagation": "rprivate"
    }
],
```

#### How do I edit the conf files or access the log files used by my docker instance?

If Hummingbot is installed on your local machine, you can access the files from your local file system in the `hummingbot_conf` and `hummingbot_logs` folder. The docker instance reads from/writes to these local files.

If Hummingbot is installed on a virtual machine, you can use the `vi` text editor (or any text editor of your choice). Do command `vi $filename`. See [this page](https://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/unix-vi-commands-take-advantage-of-the-unix-vi-editor-374) for more information how to use this text editor.

You can also use an FTP client software (e.g. WinSCP, FileZila) to copy, move, files and folders from your virtual machine to your local machine and vice versa.


#### How do I copy and paste in Docker Toolbox (Windows)?

By default, the Docker Toolbox has copy and paste disabled within the command line. This can make it difficult to port long API and wallet keys to Hummingbot. However, there is a simple fix which can be enabled as follows:

1 - Open up the Docker Toolbox via the Quickstart Terminal

2 - Right-click on the title bar of Toolbox and select "Properties"

  ![](/assets/img/docker_toolbox_properties.png)

3 - Check the box under the "Options" tab to enable "Ctrl Key Shortcuts"

Close any warnings, and you're done! Just hit enter to move onto the next line and you should be able to copy and paste text using **Ctrl+Shift+C** and **Ctrl+Shift+V**.


#### How do I paste items from clipboard in PuTTY?

You should be able to paste items from your clipboard by doing mouse right-click or `SHIFT + right-click`. If that doesn't work, follow the steps below.

1 - If you are currently logged in a session, do a left-click on the upper left hand corner of the PuTTY window or a right-click anywhere on the title bar then select "Change Settings". If not, proceed to step 2.

2 - In PuTTY configuration under Window category go to "Selection". Select the "Window" radio button for action of mouse buttons.

3 - You can now paste items from clipboard by doing a right-click to bring up the menu and select "Paste".

#### Alternative ways of copy and paste

```bash
# Windows / Linux

# Copy
Ctrl + C 
Ctrl + Insert
Ctrl + Shift + C

# Paste
Ctrl + V
Shift + Insert
Ctrl + Shift + V
```

#### How do I use the same email and ETH address for liquidity bounty when running multiple bots?

Run the command `bounty --restore-id` in the other instance(s). Enter the email address you used to register for liquidity bounties where the verification code will be sent.

Alternatively, you can also follow these steps below.

- Installed from Docker:

Create and run multiple Docker instances that use the same file folder location for configs and logs. Each instance will then use the same `conf_liquidity_bounty.yml` file.

- Installed from source:

1 - Register for liquidity bounties using your email and ETH address

2 - Exit Hummingbot and open `conf/conf_liquidity_bounty.yml`

3 - Copy the contents of this file

4 - Create another instance of Hummingbot

5 - Paste what you copied in step 3 into `conf/conf_liquidity_bounty.yml` in this new instance


#### How do I update Hummingbot after I had previously installed using old instructions?

If you have previously installed Hummingbot using Docker and our previous documentation naming conventions, can you copy and paste the following command to update to the latest naming as well as to enable the user scripts:

Copy the commands below and run from the root folder (i.e. when you type `ls`, make sure you see the `my-hummingbot` folder).

* If your previous instance was named `my-hummingbot` (check by running `docker ps -a`):

```bash
# Remove instance
docker rm my-hummingbot && \
# Remove old image
docker image rm coinalpha/hummingbot:latest && \
# Rename file folder
sudo mv my-hummingbot hummingbot_files && \
# Start new instance
docker run -it \
--name hummingbot-instance \
--mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_conf,destination=/conf/" \
--mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_logs,destination=/logs/" \
coinalpha/hummingbot:latest
```

* If your previous instance was named `my-instance-1` (check by running `docker ps -a`):

```bash
# Remove instance
docker rm my-instance-1 && \
# Remove old image
docker image rm coinalpha/hummingbot:latest && \
# Rename file folder
sudo mv my-hummingbot hummingbot_files && \
# Start new instance
docker run -it \
--name hummingbot-instance \
--mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_conf,destination=/conf/" \
--mount "type=bind,source=$(pwd)/hummingbot_files/hummingbot_logs,destination=/logs/" \
coinalpha/hummingbot:latest
```

You will then be able to use the [automated docker scripts](/cheatsheets/docker/#automated-docker-scripts-optional).
