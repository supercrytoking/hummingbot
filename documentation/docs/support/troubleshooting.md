# Troubleshooting

Some of the common error messages found when using Hummingbot and how to resolve.

## Installed via Docker

#### Permission denied after installation

```
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at
unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post
http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.39/containers/create?name=hummingbot_instance:
dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.
```

Exit from your virtual machine and restart.

#### Package 'docker.io' has no installation candidate

![](/assets/img/package-docker-io.png)

Install Docker using get.docker.com script as an alternative. Install `curl` tool then download and run get.docker.com script.

```bash
apt-get install curl
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

Allow docker commands without requiring `sudo` prefix (optional).

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
```

Exit and restart terminal.

## Installed from source

#### Conda command not found

```
$ conda
-bash: conda: command not found
```

If you have just installed conda, close terminal and reopen a new terminal to update the command line's program registry.

If you use `zshrc` or another shell other than `bash`, see the note at the bottom of this section: [install dependencies](/installation/from-source/macos/#part-1-install-dependencies).

#### Syntax error invalid syntax

```
File "bin/hummingbot.py", line 40
  def detect_available_port(starting_port: int) -> int:
                                           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Make sure you have activated the conda environment: `conda activate hummingbot`.

#### Module not found error

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hummingbot.market.market_base'

root - ERROR - No module named
‘hummingbot.strategy.pure_market_making.inventory_skew_single_size_sizing_delegate’
(See log file for stack trace dump)
```

Exit Hummingbot to compile and restart using these commands:

```bash
conda activate hummingbot
./compile
bin/hummingbot.py
```

## Installed in Windows (Docker Toolbox)

Windows users may encounter the following error when running the Docker Toolbox for Windows:

```
C:\Program Files\Docker Toolbox\docker.exe:
Error response from daemon: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/:net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection
(Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers).
See 'C:\Program Files\Docker Toolbox\docker.exe run --help'.
```

This appears to be an environment configuration problem. The solution is to refresh the environment settings and restart the environment which can be done with the following commands:

```bash
# Restart the environment
docker-machine restart default

# Refresh your environment settings
eval $(docker-machine env default)
```

## Running Hummingbot

#### Binance errors in logs

These are known issues from the Binance API and Hummingbot will attempt to reconnect afterwards.

```
hummingbot.market.binance.binance_market - NETWORK - Unexpected error while fetching account updates.

AttributeError: 'ConnectionError' object has no attribute 'code'
AttributeError: 'TimeoutError' object has no attribute 'code'

hummingbot.core.utils.async_call_scheduler - WARNING - API call error:
('Connection aborted.', OSError("(104, 'ECONNRESET')",))

hummingbot.market.binance.binance_market - NETWORK - Error fetching trades update for the order
[BASE]USDT: ('Connection aborted.', OSError("(104, 'ECONNRESET')",)).
```

!!! note
    Hummingbot should run normally regardless of these errors. If the bot fails to perform or behave as expected (e.g. placing and cancelling orders, performing trades, stuck orders, orders not showing in exchange, etc.) you can get help through our [support channels](/support/index).


#### IDEX errors in logs

You may see any of these errors in logs when trading on IDEX market. These are server-side issues on IDEX's end.

```

HTTP status is 500 - {'error': 'Something went wrong. Try again in a moment.'}
```

!!! note
    Hummingbot should run normally regardless of these errors. If the bot fails to perform or behave as expected (e.g. placing and cancelling orders, performing trades, stuck orders, orders not showing in exchange, etc.) you can get help through our [support channels](/support/index).


#### No orders generated in paper trading mode

Errors will appear if any of the tokens in `maker_market_symbol` and/or `taker_market_symbol` has no balance in the paper trade account.
