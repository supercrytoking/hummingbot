# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some of the common questions from our users about running Hummingbot.

### Iâ€™m running on pure market making strategy. Why is it only placing buy orders and not sell orders? (or vice-versa)

Check the balance in your inventory. If you don't have enough balance on one side, it will only place orders on the side that it can. This is fine and expected behavior for the strategy.

### What settings or parameter values should I use to make profitable trades?

We generally don't advise on parameter values. As a market maker, testing different parameters and seeing how they perform is really the art or science of market making.
