    Currently, our Discord server is the only officially-supported online Hummingbot community. We do not maintain any other communities on Telegram, WeChat, Slack, or other applications. Please beware that any such communities (except for the official Hummingbot Discord) may be scams.

## GitHub
You can submit issues for bugs, exchange connector requests and feature requests in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/coinalpha/hummingbot).

## Hummingbot DevForum
For long-form questions, we recommend that you post them on our [DevForum](https://forum.hummingbot.io/t/welcome-to-the-hummingbot-devforum/7) so that both of the questions and the answers will be easily searchable for other developers who might have the same questions.

If you are also looking for collaborators on connector building or other projects, you can also post it in our forum.

## Hummingbot Blog
You can read through our [blog posts](https://hummingbot.io/blog/#tags) to learn more about market making, algorithmic trading, and decentralized finance.
