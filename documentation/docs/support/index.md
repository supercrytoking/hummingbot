# Getting Support and Help

There are various ways that you can get help with Hummingbot and contribute to our community. We also have other useful resources to learn more about Hummingbot, algorithmic trading, etc.

## Discord
Our official [Discord server](https://discord.hummingbot.io) is the primary gathering spot for announcements, user support, trading strategies, connectors, and other discussion about Hummingbot.

**When you sign up for our Discord, please check that the link you are accessing is `https://discord.hummingbot.io`.**

For users reporting issues, these 3 items will help us triage your issue:

1. **Screenshot**: In the Hummingbot client, run the `status` command and take a screenshot that includes the full terminal/bash window. Make sure to include both the left pane and the right log pane of Hummingbot.

2. **Strategy config file**: This is the file with the parameters associated with your strategy. It does not contain API keys, wallet private keys, or other confidential data. It is located in the `conf/` folder. For example, if you have configured a pure market making strategy for the first time, the file's default name is `conf_pure_market_making_0.yml`.

3. **Log file**: This is the file that contains a detailed log output and error stack trace. It is located in the `logs/` folder. If you are sending logs related to your most recent Hummingbot session, sort the folder for the most recently updated file. It should have a name similar to `hummingbot_logs_2019-07-31-19-51-36.log`.

!!! warning
    Currently, our Discord server is the only officially-supported online Hummingbot community. We do not maintain any other communities on Telegram, WeChat, Slack, or other applications. Please beware that any such communities (except for the official Hummingbot Discord) may be scams.

## GitHub
You can submit issues for bugs, exchange connector requests and feature requests in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/coinalpha/hummingbot).

## Hummingbot DevForum
For long-form questions, we recommend that you post them on our [DevForum](https://forum.hummingbot.io/t/welcome-to-the-hummingbot-devforum/7) so that both of the questions and the answers will be easily searchable for other developers who might have the same questions.

If you are also looking for collaborators on connector building or other projects, you can also post it in our forum.

## Hummingbot Blog
You can read through our [blog posts](https://hummingbot.io/blog/#tags) to learn more about market making, algorithmic trading, and decentralized finance.

## YouTube Channel
We have a compilation of helpful videos in our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxzzdEnDRbylLMWmaMjywOA) where we also conduct a weekly live show for Hummingbot users and the crypto algo trading community.
