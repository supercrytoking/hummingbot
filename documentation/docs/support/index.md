# Getting Support and Help

There are various ways that you can get help with Hummingbot and contribute to our community.

## Discord
Our official [Discord server](https://discord.hummingbot.io) is the primary gathering spot for announcements, user support, trading strategies, connectors, and other discussion about Hummingbot.

**When you sign up for our Discord, please check that the link you are accessing is `https://discord.hummingbot.io`.**

!!! warning
    Currently, our Discord server is the only officially-supported online Hummingbot community. We do not maintain any other communities on Telegram, WeChat, Slack, or other applications. Please beware that any such communities (except for the official Hummingbot Discord) may be scams.

## Github
You can submit issues for bugs and/or feature requests in our [Github repo](https://github.com/coinalpha/hummingbot).

## Bug Bounty Program
We run a [bug bounty program](/support/bug-bounty-program) that rewards users who report new bugs that we fix.

## Meetup
We help maintain a regular meetup for people interested in quantitative crypto trading. Meetups physically occur in the Bay Area, but they are also livestreamed for virtual attendees.
