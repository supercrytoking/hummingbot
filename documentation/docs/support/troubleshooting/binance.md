# Binance Error Messages

Common errors found in logs when running Hummingbot on Binance connector.

!!! note
    Hummingbot should run normally regardless of these errors. If the bot fails to perform or behave as expected (e.g. placing and cancelling orders, performing trades, stuck orders, orders not showing in exchange, etc.) you can get help through our [support channels](/support/index).

These are known issues from the Binance API and Hummingbot will attempt to reconnect afterwards.
