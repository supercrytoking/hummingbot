# Known Issues

Below, we list commonly reported issues and their resolution status.

## Outstanding

### Trades may not be profitable at lower min_profitability values

Hummingbot does not yet take into account exchange fees and gas costs. In addition, for trading strategies that trade on two different markets, order book shifts may cause one or more legs of the trade to execute at a worse price that anticipated.

We are working on features that will bake fee/gas calculations in Hummingbot and enable users to more easily diagnose trade performance.

### Coinbase Pro: certain pairs only support limit orders

Hummingbot's **arbitrage** and **cross-exchange market making** strategies rely on the ability to place market orders. Certain Coinbase Pro trading pairs may be moved to limit-only mode, as described in this <a href="https://status.pro.coinbase.com/incidents/hyfyg5zsqk1w" target="_blank">incident report</a>. This m

Currently, market orders for USDC trading pairs on Coinbase Pro cannot yet be placed via API. 

This means that these pairs should not be used with the **arbitrage** strategy, nor as the `taker_market` in the **cross-exchange market making strategy**. Since USDC market orders will fail, the Coinbase Pro leg of the trade will not be executed.

## Resolved

### Maker order size must be greater than 0
Users running Hummingbot reported seeing the following error in the log messages:
```
ValueError: Maker order size (0.0) must be greater than 0.
```
**Resolution:** In the [cross-exchange market making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making) and [arbitrage](/strategies/arbitrage) strategies, Hummingbot automatically sets a trade size equal to 1/6 of the total portfolio value across both exchanges. When the user's balance in one account is too small or imbalanced, this may result in trade sizes which are lower than the exchange's minimum order size. We recommend that users either:

* utilize the `trade_size_override` setting in the strategy configuration file to manually set the trade size, denominated in the quote asset, or;
* add a sufficient quantity of assets so that asset inventory across exchanges is roughly equal (see [Running bots: Inventory requirements](/operation/running-bots/#inventory-requirements) for more detail).

### Missing file: hummingbot_logs.yml
Users who installed Hummingbot from source saw the following error upon starting Hummingbot:
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/user_name/hummingbot/conf/hummingbot_logs.yml'
```
**Resolution:** Fixed in v0.5.0. Users who installed an earlier version can solve this issue by creating a file called `hummingbot_logs.yml` in Hummingbot's `conf` directory and populating its contents with one of the templates in the [log_templates](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/templates/log_templates) directory.

### No module named `eth_account`

**Resolution**: There are a couple reasons why you may see this error:

* **Anaconda environment not activated:** If you installed Hummingbot from source, check that you have run `conda activate hummingbot` before running Hummingbot. You will see a `(hummingbot)` prefix in the command line if the environment is active,
* **Installation/compilation errors:** There may have been errors during the installation or compilation process that prevented installation of certain library dependencies. Uninstall Hummingbot by running `./uninstall` and install from source again. If you still see the error, create an Github issue and include the output of the `./install` and `./compile` commands.

### Order book is empty
A user who run Hummingbot reported seeing the following error message in the log messages:
```
OSError: Order book is empty - no price quote is available
```
**Resolution:** This error is displayed when the order book is thinner than a certain threshold. We suggest that you double check the token symbols you entered in the strategy configuration file. If the symbol of the pair doesnâ€™t exist on certain exchanges, this error will also be displayed.

### No module named `zero_ex`

Users who installed Hummingbot from source on Ubuntu saw the following error upon starting Hummingbot:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named `zero_ex`
```
**Resolution:** Fixed in [v0.4.0](/release-notes/0.4.0); the cause was missing libraries in `setup/environment-linux.yml`

### No module named `wings.web3_wallet`

Users reported the following error upon starting Hummingbot:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'wings.web3_wallet' 
```
**Resolution:** Make sure that you are in the root hummingbot directory when compiling or starting Hummingbot.

### Pip subprocess error: failed building wheel for...

Users who install Hummingbot from source on Ubuntu saw the following error upon running `./compile`:
```
Pip subprocess error:
  Failed building wheel for cytoolz
  Failed building wheel for lru-dict
  Failed building wheel for regex
  Failed building wheel for twisted
```
**Resolution:** Hummingbot uses `gcc` and `make` to correctly install dependencies. We recommend installing the `build-essential` package:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

### Trading pair selection

Hummingbot throws an error if the trading pair entered by the user isn't available on the exchange. However, each exchange may have different syntax for their trading pairs, and different trading pairs, by convention, may switch the base asset and the quote asset.

**Resolution:** In [v0.2.0](/release-notes/0.2.0), we added tab autocomplete and dropdown menus to trading pair selection in the `config` process.
