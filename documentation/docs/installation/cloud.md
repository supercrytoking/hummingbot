# Setup a Cloud Server

Using Hummingbot as a long running service can be achieved with the help of cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure. You may read our blog about running [Hummingbot on different cloud providers](https://www.hummingbot.io/blog/2019-06-cloud-providers/).

As of **version 0.28.0** installing Docker takes up around 500 MB of storage space and 4 GB for Hummingbot Docker image. We tested to install and run Hummingbot on these free to lowest machine types.

| Provider | Instance Type | Instance Details |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Google Cloud Platform <img width=50/> | g1-small <img width=100/> | 1 vCPU, 1.7 GB memory <img width=100/> |
| Amazon Web Services | t2.micro | 1 vCPU, 1 GB memory |
| Microsoft Azure | Standard_E2s_v3 | 2 vCPU, 16 GB memory |

These instances are pre-loaded with system files that takes up around 1.2 GB so we recommend having at least **8 GB of storage space** in your cloud server.

Below, we show you how to set up a new Virtual Machine Instance on each major cloud platform.

## Google Cloud Platform

   * Navigate to the Google Cloud Platform console
   * Create an instance of Compute Instance
   * Select “New VM Instance”, then pick `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS`

   * Click on "SSH" to SSH into the newly created VM instance

## Amazon Web Services

   * Navigate to the AWS Management Console
   * Click on "Launch a Virtual Machine"

   ![Create New Instance](/assets/img/aws1.png)

   * Select `Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM)`

   ![Select Server Type](/assets/img/aws2.png)

   * Choose an Instance Type: 
   
     The Free tier `t2.micro` option should be enough for beginner user running a single bot.
    
     ![Select Instance Type](/assets/img/aws3.png)
     AWS's `t2.micro` instance allocates 7.7 GB of storage by default. After docker and hummingbot installation,
     3.5 GB remains for logs and data files generated by the client. 
     
     If you are running multiple bots in the same instance, you may want to consider choose an Instance Type that 
     offers more storage.

     After you have chosen an Instance Type, click on "Review and Launch", and then "Launch"
     
   * Select “create a new key pair”, name the key pair (e.g. hummingbot), download key pair, and then click on “Launch Instances”.

   * Click on “View Instances”

   * To connect to the instance from the terminal, click on “Connect” and then follow the instructions on the resulting page.

## Microsoft Azure

   * Navigate to the Virtual Machines console.
   * Click on the "Add" button in the top-left corner.

   ![Create New Instance](/assets/img/azure1.png)

   * Choose a name for the resource group and for the VM itself.
   * Select `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS` for the image type and `Standard D2s v3` for the size.

   ![Select Server Type](/assets/img/azure2.png)

   * Under "Administrator Account", choose password and select a username and password.
   * Under "Inbound Port Rules", select SSH and HTTP.

   * Scroll up to the top and click on "Management" tab.
   * Choose a valid name for your diagnostics storage account.

   * Go to the "Review and Create" tab, click on "Create".

   ![Create the Virtual Machine](/assets/img/azure5.png)

   * While your VM is being created, download and install PuTTY for your OS.

   * After your VM has been initialized, copy the public IP address.
   * Open the PuTTY app and paste the IP address into the host name, then open.
