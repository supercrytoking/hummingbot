# API keys

In order to trade on a centralized exchange and IDEX, you will need to import your API key from that exchange to Hummingbot. API keys are account specific credentials that allow access to live information and trading outside of the exchange website.

Please see below for instructions to find your API keys for the exchanges that Hummingbot currently supports:

* [Binance](/connectors/binance)

* [Coinbase Pro](/connectors/coinbase)

* [Huobi Global](/connectors/huobi/#creating-huobi-api-keys)

* [IDEX](/connectors/idex/#api-key)

!!! warning "API key permissions"
    We recommend using only **"trade"** enabled API keys; enabling **"withdraw", "transfer", or the equivalent** is unnecessary for current Hummingbot strategies.
