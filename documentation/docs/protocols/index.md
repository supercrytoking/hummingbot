Hummingbot features connectors to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on various blockchain protocols. 

Trading on protocols generally require you to connect a **wallet** which gives Hummingbot access to your token balances and enables Hummingbot to automate transactions. In addition, you need to configure access to **node** in order to send and receive blockchain data.

Below are the currently supported protocols in Hummingbot:

* [Ethereum](./ethereum)
* [Celo](./celo)
* [Terra](./terra)

## Hummingbot Gateway

Hummingbot uses a standalone middleware component called [Hummingbot Gateway](./gateway) in order to connect to protocols. See the Gateway page for instructions on how to set up Gateway.
