# Huobi Global Connector

## About Huobi Global

Huobi is a global, centralized cryptocurrency exchange that was started in Singapore, and has since expanded its offices to Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, and the United States. As of March 2018, Huobi processed around US $1 billion in trades daily.


## Using the Connector

Because [Huobi](https://www.hbg.com/) is a centralized exchange, you will need to generate and provide your API key in order to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your Huobi API key >>>
Enter your Huobi secret key >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

!!! warning "API key permissions"
    We recommend using only **"trade"** enabled API keys; enabling **"withdraw", "transfer", or the equivalent** is unnecessary for current Hummingbot strategies.

4 - Your Access Key and Secret Key will only be shown to you once. Make sure to save and keep this information somewhere safe. If you lose your Secret Key, you can delete the API and create a new one. However, it will be impossible to reuse the same API.

5 - Information related to your API keys such as create date, notes, permissions, bind IP address, days remaining before expiration, status are shown under **My API Key**. Click **Edit** button to change the permission setting or bind/unbind to an IP address anytime.
