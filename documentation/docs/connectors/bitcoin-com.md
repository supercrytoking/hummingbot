## Using the Connector

Centralized exchanges like [Bitcoin.com](https://exchange.bitcoin.com/) requires your API keys in order to trade using Hummingbot.

```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

## Miscellaneous Info

### Minimum Order Sizes



## Transaction Fees

Generally, trading fees are 0.20% for taker and 0.10% for maker orders. You can check this through REST API reference.

```
https://api.exchange.bitcoin.com/api/2/public/symbol
```

The trading pair symbol can also be added to the URL to be more specific.

For example, `GET /api.exchange.bitcoin.com/api/2/public/symbol/ETHBCH` returns JSON structured like this:

```
{
    "id": "ETHBCH",
    "baseCurrency": "ETH",
    "quoteCurrency": "BCH",
    "quantityIncrement": "0.0001",
    "tickSize": "0.00001",
    "takeLiquidityRate": "0.002",
    "provideLiquidityRate": "0.001",
    "feeCurrency": "BCH"
}
```

`takeLiquidityRate` is the taker fee while `provideLiquidityRate` is the maker fee in `feeCurrency` value.
