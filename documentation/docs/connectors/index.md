# Connectors

## What are connectors?

Connectors are packages of code that link Hummingbot's internal trading algorithms with live information from different cryptocurrency exchanges. They interact with a given exchange's API, such as by gathering order book data and sending and cancelling trades. See below for the list of exchanges which Hummingbot currently has connectors to.

## Connector types

* **spot**: Connectors to order book exchanges that trade spot markets
* **perp**: Connectors to order book exchanges that trade perpetual swap markets
* **amm**: Connectors to automatic market maker (AMM) exchanges on various blockchain protocols. Trading on these exchanges requires

For each decentralized exchange (DEX) connector, we list the underlying blockchain protocol supported by Hummingbot.
