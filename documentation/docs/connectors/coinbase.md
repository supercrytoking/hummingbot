# Coinbase Pro Connector

## About Coinbase Pro

Coinbase Pro is a highly popular, global cryptocurrency exchange designed for professional traders based out of San Francisco, California. It has a reputation for being secure and trustworthy, and accounts on the exchange backed by FDIC insurance.

## Using the Connector

Because Coinbase Pro is a centralized exchange, you will need to generate and provide your API key in order to trade using Hummingbot.

### Creating Coinbase Pro API Keys

1 - Log into your Coinbase Pro account, click your avatar and then select **API** (If you do not have an account, you will have to create one and verify your ID).
