# Coinbase Pro Connector

## About Coinbase Pro

Based in San Francisco, CA, Coinbase Pro is a widely-used, global cryptocurrency exchange designed for professional traders. It has a reputation for being secure and trustworthy, is [regulated in all the jurisdictions in which it operates](https://www.coinbase.com/legal/insurance), and maintains some [insurance on assets and deposits](https://www.coinbase.com/legal/insurance).

## Using the Connector

Because Coinbase Pro is a centralized exchange, you will need to generate and provide your API key in order to trade using Hummingbot.

```
Enter your Coinbase API key >>>
Enter your Coinbase secret key >>>
Enter your Coinbase passphrase >>>
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.

Make sure you give permissions to **View** and **Trade**, and enter your 2FA code.

!!! warning "API key permissions"
    We recommend using only **"trade"** enabled API keys; enabling **"withdraw", "transfer", or the equivalent** is unnecessary for current Hummingbot strategies.

Once you pass the authentication, youâ€™ve created a new API Key!

Your API Secret will be displayed on the screen. Make sure you store your API Secret somewhere secure, and do not share it with anyone.

When you close the API Secret screen, your API key will be shown in **My API Keys**. The code highlighted in red is your API key.
