# Loopring Exchange Connector

## About Loopring

Loopring is the first scalable DEX protocol built with zkRollup for Ethereum. Loopring Exchange is the first decentralized trading platform built on top of the Loopring protocol. Loopring Exchange is accessible at Loopring.io

## Using the Connector

To use the Loopring Exchange connector to trade using Hummingbot, you will need to provide your API key, private key, and other details.

```
Enter your Loopring account id >>>
Enter the Loopring exchange id >>> 
Enter your Loopring private key >>> 
Enter your loopring api key >>> 
```

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only. At no point will private or API keys be shared to CoinAlpha or be used in any way other than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.
