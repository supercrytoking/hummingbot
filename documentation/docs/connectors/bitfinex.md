## Using the Connector

To use Bitfinex connector, you will need to generate and provide your API key in order to trade using Hummingbot.

Private keys and API keys are stored locally for the operation of the Hummingbot client only.
 At no point will private or API keys be shared to someone or be used in any way other 
 than to authorize transactions required for the operation of Hummingbot.
