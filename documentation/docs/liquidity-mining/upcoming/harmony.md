# Harmony
[Harmony (ONE)](https://harmony.one/) is a new base-layer blockchain that aims to offer a high-throughput, low-latency, and low-fee consensus platform for decentralized economies. Partnering with Harmony, we launched a successful pilot program rewarding community members for running market making bots for $ONE using Hummingbot. In early 2020, we'll roll out our newly-designed liquidity mining program for Harmony.  

## Timeline

This liquidity mining program will run for 12 weeks starting in early February 2020.

## Rewards

Liquidity miners can earn rewards based on a formula that takes into account duration and consistency of orders placed over time, spreads, and sizes. You'll be able to check your earned rewards by minute, and your total earned balance in the "Activity" section. 

## How to Participate

1. Register for the program on the liquidity mining web APP by entering your wallet information and read-only exchange API keys. 
2. Start market making for any ONE trading pair and Earn rewards! ðŸ˜Ž (The rewards will be automatically calculated based on your trading acitivities for eligible pairs collected through the exchange APIs you provide.)

!!! note
    If you want to participate using Hummingbot, you can [download Hummingbot](https://hummingbot.io/download) on the website, or follow the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart/) to install and configure Hummingbot. Configure and run a bot that uses either the [pure market making](/strategies/pure-market-making) or the [cross-exchange market making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making) strategy.
