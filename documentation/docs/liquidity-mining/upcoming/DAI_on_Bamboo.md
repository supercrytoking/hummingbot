## Bamboo Relay
[Bamboo Relay](https://bamboorelay.com/) is a decentralized crypto exchange built upon 0x protocol. Users can trade, lend or borrow any ERC20 token trustlessly from their own wallet. [0x](https://0x.org/) sponsors this program with a goal to improve the liquidity for its Relayers.   

## Timeline

This liquidity mining program will be initially running for 12 weeks from early February 2020 with probability for extension. 

## Rewards

Liquidity minders can earn rewards based on a formula that takes how long you've been placing orders over time, the spreads and your order sized into consideration. You'll be able to check your earned rewards by minute, and your total earned balance in the "activity" section. 

## How to Participate

1. Register for the program on the liquidity mining web APP by entering your wallet information and read-only exchange API keys. 
2. Start market making for WETH/DAI on Bamboo Relay and Earn rewards! ðŸ˜Ž (The rewards will be automatically calculated based on your trading acitivities for eligible pairs collected through the exchange APIs you provide.)
