## Epochs
Each weekly epoch starts and ends at **Tuesday 12:00am UTC time**. 

The **Snapshot Explorer** shows your earnings across all markets in each per-minute snapshot, expressed in USD terms, 

During each weekly epoch, your liquidity rewards earnings will accumulate in the **Mining Rewards Balance**.

## Payouts
Payouts occur 3 calendar days after each weekly epoch, at **Friday 12:00am UTC time**. Liquidity Miners will be notified via email with a breakdown of their earnings during the epoch. 

Your historical payouts are listed in the **Payouts History** pane.
