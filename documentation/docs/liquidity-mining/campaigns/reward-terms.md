# Reward terms


⚠️ **Terms are potentially subject to change weekly**.  Please check this site for the most up-to-date terms.  We will notify participants of changes, if any, through email (for registered users) and on our [Discord](https://discord.hummingobt.io).

- Liquidity mining rewards will be determined based on weekly periods.
- **Snapshots**: for each reward period (e.g. one week), the amount of rewards is distributed equally for each minute within that period.  For each minute, a random snapshot is taken from that minute to be used for calculating reward allocations.
- **Reward roll-over**: if there are no eligible orders submitted for a specific snapshot, the amount of rewards due for that snapshot will roll-over to the rewards allocated for the subsequent snapshot.
- Rewards are paid weekly, approximately 3 business days after the end of each period.
- Rewards for each pair are allocated 50%/50% to bid and ask orders.
- Reward allocations for each token pair are calculated independently, and for each token, bid and ask side rewards are calculated independently.
- Each payment distribution will be based on qualifying activity in the immediately preceding period.
