# Liquidity Mining

## Overview
Liquidity mining is a community-based, data-driven approach to market making, in which a token issuer or exchange can reward a pool of miners to provide liquidity for a specified token.

Liquidity mining sets forth an analytical framework for determining market maker compensation based on (1) time (order book consistency), (2) order spreads, and (3) order sizes, in order to create a fair model for compensation that aligns a miner's risk with rewards.
