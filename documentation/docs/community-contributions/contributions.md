#### Performance calculator

Our long-time user and the Eagle Club member, [Dominator008](https://github.com/Dominator008) has created a simple [Hummingbot performance calculator](https://github.com/Dominator008/hummingbot-trades-calculator), which prints differences in the base and quote currencies, and calculates profitability in terms of the quote currency based on the final price of the base currency.
