## How It Works

The `history` command in Hummingbot will show the current session's past trades, inventory, duration, market trading pair performance, and return percentage.


## Trade Value Delta

Total Trade Value Delta is calculated as the difference between the total assets acquired and total assets spent, specified in quote value.

$trade\_value\_delta = (acquired - spent)$

To get the quote value of base asset (acquired or spent), multiply the base value to end price.

```
Inventory:

Markets:                                                                   
      Market     Pair Start Price       End Price  Trades Trade Value Delta
  0  binance  ETHUSDT     203.913  203.6150000000       4  -0.56200000 USDT
```

After executing these trades we acquired **2 ETH** equivalent to 407.23 USDT `(2 ETH * 203.615)` and spent **407.7920 USDT** tokens.

```
Trade Value Delta = (407.23 USDT - 407.7920 USDT)
Trade Value Delta = -0.562 USDT
```


## Return Percentage

Return is calculated based on assets spent and acquired during trades, i.e. balance changes due to the inventory like deposits, withdrawals, and manual trades outside of Hummingbot do not affect the calculation.

$Return\ \% = trade\_value\_delta / starting\_quote\_value$

```
Inventory:

Markets:

  0  binance  ETHUSDT     203.913  203.6150000000       4  -0.56200000 USDT
```

Using the same example, get the starting quote value. Convert the starting ETH amount to USDT by multiplying to the start price and add the amount of quote assets. So we started with 2,039.13 USDT worth of ETH `(10 ETH * 203.913)` and 500 USDT total of **2539.13 USDT**.

```
Return % = -0.562 USDT / 2539.13 USDT
Return % = -0.0222 %
```
