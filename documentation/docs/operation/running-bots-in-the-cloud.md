# Running Bots in the Cloud

!!! tip
    Read our blog about running [Hummingbot on different cloud providers](https://www.hummingbot.io/blog/2019-06-cloud-providers/).

## Keep Bots Running in the Background

To run an instance in the background on the cloud, run either of the following commands: `screen` or `screen -S $NAME`, where $NAME is what you wish to call this background instance. Use the latter to be more explicit if you want to run multiple bots.

Then start the bot like normal. To exit the screen, press `Ctrl-A-D`.

To log back into the screen, either use `screen` or `screen -r $NAME` to open a specific instance of your screen. To list all running instances, use `screen -ls`.

We recommend that users download separate docker images for each client that they wish to run.

## Access Cloud Instances on your Phone

Use Hummingbot's [Telegram integration](/operation/telegram) to connect to your cloud instance without a computer. Note that this has limited functionality and remains a work in progress.
