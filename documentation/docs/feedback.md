# Providing Feedback

## Discord

Presently, alpha testers should submit questions and issues to the *#alpha-program* private channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.hummingbot.io).

If you are an alpha tester and would like to join this channel, please send your Discord username to [contact@hummingbot.io](mailto:contact@hummingbot.io).

## Github Issues
After we open source the Hummingbot codebase at the end of March, users will be able to submit issues and pull requests in the Github repository.
