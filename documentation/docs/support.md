# Support

We recognize that running a trading bot for the first time is a big step for many new users, so we maintain 24/7 live support to assist our users.

## Needed support info

Before reporting bugs or issues, please collect these three items which helps our support team triage your issue promptly.

1. **Screenshot**: In the Hummingbot client, run the `status` command and take a screenshot that includes the full terminal/bash window. Make sure to include both the left pane and the right log pane of Hummingbot.

2. **Strategy config file**: This is the file with the parameters associated with your strategy. It does not contain API keys, wallet private keys, or other confidential data. It is located in the `conf/` (Windows and macOS) or `hummingbot_conf/` (Docker) folder. For example, if you have configured a pure market making strategy for the first time, the file's default name is `conf_pure_market_making_0.yml`.

3. **Log file**: This is the file that contains a detailed log output and error stack trace. It is located in the `logs/` (Windows and macOS) or `hummingbot_logs/` (Docker) folder. If you are sending logs related to your most recent Hummingbot session, sort the folder for the most recently updated file. It should have a name similar to `logs_conf_pure_market_making_0.log`.
