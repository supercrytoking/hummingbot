# Pure Market Making

## How it Works

In the *pure* market making strategy, Hummingbot continually posts limit bid and ask offers on a market and waits for other market participants ("takers") to fill their orders.

Users can specify how far away ("spreads") from the mid price the bid and asks are, the order quantity, and how often prices should be updated (order cancels + new orders posted).

!!! warning
    Please exercise caution while running this strategy and set appropriate stop loss limits. The current version of this strategy is intended to be a basic template that users can test and customize. Running the strategy with substantial capital without additional modifications may result in losses.

### Schematic

The diagram below illustrates how market making works.  Hummingbot makes a market by placing buy and sell orders on a single exchange, specifying prices and sizes.

## Prerequisites: Inventory

1. You will need to hold inventory of quote and base currencies on the exchange.
2. You will also need some Ethereum to pay gas for transactions on a DEX (if applicable).

## Configuration Walkthrough

The following walks through all the steps when running `config` for the first time.

!!! tip "Tip: Autocomplete Inputs during Configuration"
    When going through the command line config process, pressing `<TAB>` at a prompt will display valid available inputs.

### Multiple Order Configuration

Multiple orders allow you to create multiple orders for each bid and ask side, e.g. multiple bid orders with different prices and different sizes.

 | Prompt | Description |
|-----|-----|
| `How many orders do you want to place on both sides, (default is 1) ? >>>`: | This sets `number_of_orders` (see [definition](#configuration-parameters)) |
| `What is the size of the first bid and ask order, (default is 1) >>>`: | This sets `order_start_size` (see [definition](#configuration-parameters)) |
| `How much do you want to increase the order size for each additional order (default is 0) ? >>>` | This sets `order_step_size` (see [definition](#configuration-parameters)) |
| `Enter the price increments (as percentage) for subsequent orders (Enter 0.01 to indicate 1%)? >>>` | This sets `order_interval_percent` (see [definition](#configuration-parameters)) |

### Inventory-Based Dynamic Order Sizing

The inventory skew function is ***currentlyavailable in single order trading mode only***.  This function allows you to specify a target base to quote asset inventory ratio and adjust order sizes whenever the current portfolio ratio deviates from this target.

For example, if you are targeting a 50/50 base to quote asset ratio but the current value of your base asset accounts for more than 50% of the value of your inventory, then bid sizes (buy base asset) are decreased, while ask sizes (sell base asset) are increased.

 | Prompt | Description |
|-----|-----|
| `Would you like to enable inventory skew? (true/false) default is false >>>`: | This sets `inventory_skew_enabled` (see [definition](#configuration-parameters)) |
| `What is your target base asset inventory percentage (Enter 0.01 to indicate 1%) >>>`: | This sets `inventory_target_base_percent` (see [definition](#configuration-parameters)) |

#### Determining order size

The input `order_amount` is adjusted by the ratio of current base (or quote) percentage versus target percentage:

## Configuration Parameters

The following parameters are fields in Hummingbot configuration files (located in the `/conf` folder, e.g. `conf/conf_pure_market_making_strategy_[#].yml`).

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **order_amount**<br /><small>(single order strategy)</small> | The order amount for the limit bid and ask orders. <br/> Ensure you have enough quote and base tokens to place the bid and ask orders. The strategy will not place orders if you do not have sufficient balance for both sides of the order <br/>
| **cancel_order_wait_time** | An amount in seconds, which is the duration for the placed limit orders. _Default value: 60 seconds_. <br/><br/> The limit bid and ask orders are cancelled and new bids and asks are placed according to the current mid price and settings at this interval.
| **bid_place_threshold** | An amount expressed in decimals (i.e. input of `0.01` corresponds to 1%) <br/> The strategy will place the buy(bid) order 1% away from the mid price if set to 0.01 <br/><br/>*Example: Assuming the following, Top bid : 99, Top ask: 101 ; mid price: 100 ( (99+ 101)/2 ). If you set bid_place_threshold to 0.1 which is 10%, it will place your buy order (bid) at 10% below mid price of 100 which is 90.*
| **ask_place_threshold** | An amount expressed in decimals (i.e. input of `0.01` corresponds to 1%) <br/> The strategy will place the sell(ask) order 1% away from the mid price if set to 0.01 <br/><br/>*Example: Assuming the following, Top bid : 99, Top ask: 101 ; mid price: 100 ( (99+ 101)/2 ). If you set ask_place_threshold to 0.1 which is 10%, it will place your sell order (ask) at 10% above mid price of 100 which is 110.*
| **number_of_orders**<br /><small>(multiple order strategy)</small> | The number of orders to place for each side.<br />*Example: entering `3` places three bid **and** three ask orders.*
| **order_start_size**<br /><small>(multiple order strategy)</small> | The size of the `first` order, which is the order closest to the mid price (i.e. best bid and best ask).
| **order_step_size**<br /><small>(multiple order strategy)</small> | The magnitude of incremental size increases for orders subsequent orders from the first order.<br />*Example: entering `1` when the first order size is `10` results in bid sizes of `11` and `12` for the second and third orders, respectively, for a `3` order strategy.*
| **order_interval_percent**<br /><small>(multiple order strategy only)</small> | The percentage amount increase in price for subsequent orders from the first order. <em>Example:<br /> for a mid price of 100, `ask_place_threshold` of 0.01, and `order_interval_percent` of 0.005,<br />the first, second, and third ask prices would be **101** (= 100 + 0.01 x 100), **101.5** (= 101 + 0.005 x 100), and **102**.</em>
| **stop_loss_pct** | The threshold amount upon which `hummingbot` will cease placing orders if the value of inventory has fallen.
| **stop_loss_price_type** | The pricing methdology used by `hummingbot` uses when calculating inventory value when evaluating the stop loss feature.<ul><li>`fixed`: uses the assets prices from when the strategy was first started.<li>`dynamic`: uses current prevailing prices for assets.</ul>
| **stop_loss_base_token** | The base currency into which inventory is valued for purposes of evaluating stop loss.
| **inventory_skew_enabled** | When this is `true`, the bid and ask order sizes are adjusted based on the `inventory_target_base_percent`.
| **inventory_target_base_percent** | An amount expressed in decimals (i.e. input of `0.01` corresponds to 1%) <br/> The strategy will place bid and ask orders with adjusted sizes (based on `order_amount`, `order_start_size`) and try to maintain this base asset vs. total (base + quote) asset value.<br/><br/>*Example: You are market making ETH / USD with `order_amount: 1` and balances of 10 ETH and 1000 USD. Your current base asset value is ~67% and quote asset value is ~33%. If `inventory_target_base_percent: 0.5`, the order amount will be adjusted from 1 ETH bid, 1 ETH ask to 0.67 ETH bid, 1.33 ETH ask.*

## Risks and Trading Mechanics

!!! warning
    Not financial or investment advice.  Below are descriptions of some risks associated with the pure market making strategy.  There may be additional risks not described below.

### Ideal case

Pure market making strategies works best when you have a market that's relatively calm, but with sufficient trading activity. What that means for a pure market makers is, he would be able to get both of his bid and ask offers traded regularly; the price of his inventory doesn't change by a lot so there's no risk of him ending up on the wrong side of a trend. Thus he would be able to repeatedly capture small profits via the bid/ask spread over time.

![Figure 2: A clam market with regular trading activity](/assets/img/pure-mm-calm.png)

In the figure above, the period between 25 Feb and 12 Mar would be an example of the ideal case. The price of the asset stayed within a relatively small range, and there was sufficient trading activity for a market maker's offers to be taken regularly.

The only thing a market maker needs to worry about in this scenario is he must make sure the trading spread he sets is larger than the trading fees given to the exchange.

### Low trading activity

Markets with low trading activity higher risk for pure market making strategies. Here's an example:

![Figure 3: A market with low trading activity](/assets/img/pure-mm-low-volume.png)

In any market with low trading activity, there's a risk where the market maker may need to hold onto inventory for a long time without a chance to trade it back. During that time, the prices of the traded assets may rise or drop dramatically despite seeing no or little trading activity on the exchange. This exposes the market maker to inventory risk, even after mitigating some of this risk by using wider bid spreads.

Other strategies may be more suitable from a risk perspective in this type of market, e.g. [cross-exchange market making](/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making).

### Volatile or trending markets

Another common risk that market makers need to be aware of is trending markets. Here's one example:

![Figure 4: A trending market](/assets/img/pure-mm-trending.png)

If a pure market maker set his spreads naively in such a market, e.g. equidistant bid/ask spread, there's a risk of the market maker's bid consistently being filled as prices trend down, while at the same time the market continues to move away from the market maker's ask, decreasing the probability of sells.  This would result in an accumulation of inventory at exactly the time where this would reduce inventory inventory value, which is "wrong-way" risk.

However, it is still possible to improve the probability of generating profits in this kind of market by skewing bid asks, i.e. setting a wider bid spread (e.g. -4%) than ask spread (e.g. +0.5%).  In this way, the market maker is trying to catch price spikes in the direction of the trend and buy additional inventory only in the event of a larger moves, but sell more quickly when there is an opportunity so as to minimize the duration the inventory is held.  This approach also has a mean reversion bias, i.e. buy only when there is a larger move downwards, in the hopes of stabilization or recovery after such a large move.

Market making in volatile or trending markets is more advanced and risky for new traders. It's recommended that a trader looking to market make in this kind of environment to get mentally familiar with it (e.g. via paper trading) before committing meaningful capital to the strategy.

### Technology / infrastructure risk

There are many moving parts when operating a market making bot that **all** have to work together in order to properly function:

- Hummingbot code
- Exchange APIs
- Ethereum blockchain and node
- Network connectivity
- Hummingbot host computer

A fault in any component may result in bot errors, which can range from minor and inconsequential to major.

It is essential for any market making bot to be able to regularly refresh its bid and ask offers on the market in order to adjust to changing market conditions.  If a market making bot is disconnected from the exchange for an extended period of time, then the bid/ask offers it previously made would be left on the market and subject to price fluctuations of the market. Those orders may be filled at a loss as market prices move, while the market maker is offline.  It is very important for any market maker to make sure technical infrastructure is secure and reliable.
