# `avellaneda_market_making`

## üìÅ [Strategy folder](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/strategy/avellaneda_market_making)

## üìù Summary

This strategy implements the market making strategy described in the classic paper [High-frequency Trading in a Limit Order Book](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/sfs33/LimitOrderBook.pdf) written by Marco Avellaneda and Sasha Stoikov. It allows users to directly adjust the kappa, gamma, and eta parameters described in the paper. It also features a simplified mode that allows the user to enter min/max spread parameters that continually recalculate the advanced parameters.

## üè¶ Exchanges supported

[`spot` exchanges](/exchanges/#spot)

## üë∑ Maintenance

* Release added: [0.38.0](/release-notes/0.38.0/) by CoinAlpha
* Maintainer: CoinAlpha

!!! note "Approximation only"
    The description below is a general approximation of this strategy. Please inspect the strategy code in **Trading Logic** above to understand exactly how it works.

Coming soon.

 <!-- 

### `parameters_based_on_spread`

The parameter acts as a toggle between beginner (parameters_based_on_spread=True) and expert mode (False). When equal to true, the strategy will require min spread, max spread, volatility multiplier, and inventory risk aversion, while if set to False, it will only ask for risk_factor, order_book_depth_factor, and order_amount_shape_factor..

### **Advanced parameters**

All 3 parameters `order_book_depth_factor`, `risk_factor` and `order_amount_shape_factor` are customizable only in expert mode (toggled by `parameters_based_on_spread`=False).

#### `order_book_depth_factor`

This parameter denoted by the letter **kappa** is directly proportional to the order book's liquidity, hence the probability of an order being filled. For more details, see the foundation paper.

#### `risk_factor`

This parameter, denoted by the letter **gamma**, is related to the aggressiveness when setting the spreads to achieve the inventory target. It is directly proportional to the asymmetry between the bid and ask spread. For more details, see the foundation paper.

### `order_amount_shape_factor`

This parameter denoted in the letter **eta** is related to the aggressiveness when setting the order amount to achieve the inventory target. It is inversely proportional to the asymmetry between the bid and ask order amount. For more details, see the foundation paper.

### `closing_time`

This parameter will be the limit time **T** (measure in days) for this ‚Äútrading cycle‚Äù. We call trading cycles the interval of time where spreads start the widest possible and end up the smallest. Once the cycle is reset, spreads will start again, being the widest possible.

### `volatility_buffer_size`

The number of ticks used as a sample size for volatility calculation.

### `order_levels`

Quantity of orders to be placed on each side of the order book. 

For example, if `order_levels = 2` , it will place **2 Buy Orders & 2 Sell Orders**.

How does it determine order level amounts and spreads?
