# `perpetual_market_making`

## üìÅ [Strategy folder](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/strategy/perpetual_market_making)

## üìù Summary

This strategy allows Hummingbot users to run a market making strategy on a single trading pair on a perpetuals swap (`perp`) order book exchange.

Similar to the `pure_market_making_strategy`, it keeps placing limit buy and sell orders on the order book and waits for other participants (takers) to fill its orders. Since outstanding perpetual swap positions are created after fills, the strategy has a number of parameters to determine when positions are closed to take profits and prevent losses.

## üè¶ Exchanges supported

[`perp` exchanges](/exchanges/#perp)

* Release added: [0.36.0](/release-notes/0.36.0/) by CoinAlpha
