# `spot_perpetual_arbitrage`

## üìÅ [Strategy folder](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/strategy/spot_perpetual_arbitrage)

## üìù Summary

This strategy looks at the price on the spot connector and the price on the derivative connector. Then it calculates the spread between the two connectors. The key features for this strategy are `min_divergence` and `min_convergence`.

When the spread between spot and derivative markets reaches a value above `min_divergence`, the first part of the operation will be executed, creating a buy/sell order on the spot connector, while opening an opposing long/short position on the derivative connector.

With the position open, the bot will scan the prices on both connectors, and once the price spread between them reaches a value below `min_convergence`, the bot will close both positions.
