**Updated as of v0.43**

## How it works

!!! note
    This is a proof-of-concept strategy that demonstrates how to dynamically maintain Uniswap-V3 positions as market prices changes. More features will be added over time based on community feedback.

This strategy creates and maintains Uniswap positions as the market price changes in order to continue providing liquidity. Currently, it does not remove or update positions.

## Prerequisites

- [Gateway API server](/installation/gateway/)
- [Ethereum Wallet](/operation/connect-exchange/#setup-ethereum-wallet)

## Specification

### Starting

1. The bot will look for information about the pool, and if it is a valid pool. If the pool doesn't exist, warn the user and stop the strategy
3. Fetch the current mid price of the pool (`last_price`)
3. If `use_volatility` is True, the bot will calculate the price volatility used to widen spreads
4. If the pool is valid, the bot will create two starting positions:
    - The SELL position with:
        - Amount of tokens added to the position = `base_token_amount`
        - `upper_price` = `(1 + sell_spread) * last_price` 
        - `lower_price` = `last_price`
    - The BUY position with:
        - Amount of tokens added to the position = `quote_token_amount`
        - `upper_price` = `last_price`
        - `lower_price` = `(1 - buy_spread) * last_price`

The bot maintains a variable `total_position_range` that defines the total price range, comprised of `upper_price` and `lower_price`, where the bot is providing liquidity.

### Running

Each tick, the bot monitors the pool mid price (`last_price`) and compare it to the bounds of `total_position_range`. It will adjust the position under the following scenarios:

**`last_price` is higher than `upper_price` of `total_position_range`**

1. Create a new SELL liquidity position, using the following values:
    - Amount of tokens of the new position = `base_token_amount`
    - Top price bound = `(1 + sell_spread) * last_price`
    - Lower price bound = `last_price`
2. Update `total_position_range`: `upper_price = (1 + sell_spread) * last_price`

**`last_price` is lower than `lower_price` of `total_position_range`**

1. Create a new BUY liquidity position, using the following values:
    - Amount of tokens of the new position = `quote_token_amount`
    - New position upper price = `last_price`
    - New position lower price = `(1 - buy_spread) * last_price`
2. Update `total_position_range`: `lower_price = (1 - buy_spread) * last_price`

## Important Notes

- Currently, the strategy does not remove existing positions. The user should do it manually through the Uniswap interace (https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool).
- The `status` command shows the current profitability of each position, using the `quote` asset as reference
