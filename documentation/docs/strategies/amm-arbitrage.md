# `amm_arb`

## üìÅ [Strategy folder](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/strategy/amm_arb)

## üìù Summary

This strategy monitors prices between a trading pair on an `amm` exchange versus another trading pair on another `spot` or `amm` exchange in order to identify arbitrage opportunities. Similar to the `arbitrage` strategy, it executes offsetting buy and sell orders in both markets in order to capture arbitrage opportunities with profitability higher than `min_profitability`, net of transaction costs, which include both blockchain transaction fees (gas) and exchange fees.

## üè¶ Exchanges supported

* [`amm` exchanges](/exchanges/#amm)
* [`spot` exchanges](/exchanges/#spot)

## üë∑ Maintenance

* Release added: [0.34.0](/release-notes/0.34.0/) by CoinAlpha
* Maintainer: CoinAlpha
