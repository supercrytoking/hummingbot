# Order Optimization

Users now have the option to automatically adjust the prices to right just above the top bid and just below the top ask.

## How It Works

This feature works best in single order mode. Take note that this does not automatically jump your orders from the bottom to the top. Instead, if your orders are already the best in the orderbook (at the top) this will adjust your prices right next to the next best orders.

It is recommended to disable `add_transaction_costs` (set to `False`) for this feature to work effectively. This is because adding transaction costs would affect the prices at which the orders are placed and they might not be at the best bid/ask.

## Sample Configuration

```json
- bid_spread: 0.1%
- ask_spread: 0.1%
- order_optimization_enabled: false
- order_optimization_depth: 0
```

Setting our bid and ask threshold to a very small value (0.1%) puts our orders at the top of the order book. The image on below shows the buy order is placed at `0.003159` and the sell order at `0.003165` with best bid ask jump mode disabled.

The image on the right has best bid ask jump enabled which places the buy order at `0.003150` and sell order at `0.003174` right just above the next best order.

Now let's enable `order_optimization_enabled`. You'll see in the next image that the buy order is placed at `0.003150` and sell order at `0.003174` right just above the next best order.

```json
- bid_spread: 0.1%
- ask_spread: 0.1%
- order_optimization_enabled: True
- order_optimization_depth: 0
```

If the next best order's price changes (not your own), your existing orders will not adjust immediately. It will wait for `order_refresh_time` to cancel your existing orders and the new orders will try to jump to just above best bid or just below best ask.

## Order Optimization Depth

This allows users to ignore dust orders specified in base currency amount. As shown in the example above, this is the normal behavior when enabling order optimization.

```json
- bid_spread: 0.1%
- ask_spread: 0.1%
- order_optimization_enabled: True
- order_optimization_depth: 0
```

Then we reconfigure and set `order_optimization_depth` to 10000.

```json
- bid_spread: 0.1%
- ask_spread: 0.1%
- order_optimization_enabled: True
- order_optimization_depth: 10000
```

Doing this ignores the first 10,000 units of orders in the orderbook and places our orders right next to them.
