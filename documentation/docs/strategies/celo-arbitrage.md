# `celo_arb`


## üìÅ [Strategy folder](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/strategy/celo_arb)

## üìù Summary

This strategy is a predecessor to the `amm_arb` strategy built specifically to help [Celo Protocol](https://celo.org/) maintain price stability for its stablecoin pairs. Like `amm_arb`, this strategy monitors prices between AMM-based exchanges on the Celo blockchain versus another trading pair on another `spot` or `amm` exchange in order to identify arbitrage opportunities. 

It executes offsetting buy and sell orders in both markets in order to capture arbitrage opportunities with profitability higher than `min_profitability`, net of transaction costs, which include both blockchain transaction fees (gas) and exchange fees.

!!! note
    Currently, this strategy requires users to install the `celo-cli` tool alongside Hummingbot. In the future, CoinAlpha plans to add a Celo connector to [Gateway](/protocols/gateway) so that the generic `amm_arb` strategy works with Celo.
