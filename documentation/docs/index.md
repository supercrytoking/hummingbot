# Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation for Hummingbot, an open source trading bot that helps you run automated, market making strategies across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges.

We'll populate these docs with a lot more content once we release the public beta version, expected by end of March 2019.

## Questions?
If you have questions about the project, the team behind it, or market making generally, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.hummingbot.io).
