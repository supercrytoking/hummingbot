## Community connectors

Community connectors are certified by the core Hummingbot team when we add them to the codebase, but they are maintained and supported by external developers.

Currently, Hummingbot has two community-contributed connectors. We welcome other exchanges to connect their exchanges to Hummingbot in the future. For more information, please refer to [this page](/connectors/#community-contributed-exchange-connectors).
