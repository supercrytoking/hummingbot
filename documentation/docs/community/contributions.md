### Community-contributed connectors

Currently, Hummingbot has two community-contributed connectors that are created and maintained by their developers. We would love to see more exchange developers join this game and connect their exchanges to Hummingbot in the future.

- Both connectors were last updated in Hummingbot v.0.21.0.
