# Installing Hummingbot

## System requirements

Hummingbot is tested and supported on the following 64-bit systems:

* Ubuntu 16.04 or later
* macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later
* Windows 10 or later (**see Windows sections below**)

## Installation options

Hummingbot can be installed locally in two ways: via Docker or from source. Docker images are easy to run in a local virtual environment regardless of OS. On the other hand, installing from source gives you full access to the code base and allows you edit strategy files on your own.

### Windows Systems

For Windows users, we strongly recommend using Docker as Hummingbot does not currently have native Windows support.

* [Install using Docker](/installation/docker_windows)
* [Install from source](/installation/windows)

*Estimated installation time: 10 minutes*

### MacOS and Linux Systems

On MacOS or Linux systems, it's quicker and easier to install Hummingbot using Docker. If you are looking to make their own modifications, however, installing from source might be a better fit.

* [Install using Docker](/installation/docker_macOS_linux)
* [Install from source](/installation/macOS_linux)

*Estimated installation time: 15 minutes*

### Using Cloud Servers

Utilizing cloud virtual machines makes it easier to run Hummingbot continuously for longer periods of time and can be configured to any OS.

* [Install in the cloud](/installation/cloud)

*Estimated installation time: 15 minutes*
