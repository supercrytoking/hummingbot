# Installing Hummingbot

## What do I need to do to start using Hummingbot?

1. **Inventory of crypto assets**: To run market making and arbitrage strategies, you need some crypto assets on the exchanges or in your Ethereum wallet. 

2. **The Hummingbot client**: You can install `hummingbot` from either [Docker](installation/docker.md) or from [source](installation/source.md)

3. **Exchange API keys**: To trade on centralized exchanges like Binance, you need exchange-specific API keys. See [API Keys](installation/api-keys.md) for more information.

4. **Ethereum wallet**: To trade on decentralized exchanges like Radar Relay and DDEX, you need an Ethereum wallet. See [Ethereum wallet](installation/wallet.md) for more information.

5. **Ethereum node**: lastly, you will need access to an Ethereum node.  You can either run your own locally or use a publicly available service such as [Alchemy Insights](https://alchemyinsights.io/hummingbot), [QuikNode](https://quiknode.io/) or [Infura](https://infura.io/).

!!! note
    Since on-chain Ethereum transactions cost gas, make sure that your wallet contains some ETH.
