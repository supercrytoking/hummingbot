# Tabs

Users can now open another tab in the left pane of Hummingbot where the log pane is supposed to be upon entering a command associated with the Tabs feature. Users can now switch between the `log pane` and the new tab they have opened simulateneously.


!!! note
    Currently, the feature only works with the `order_book` parameter.

## Opening and Closing

### Opening a tab

Use the tabs by simply inputting a command associated with the tabs feature.

Upon using the `order_book` command and any suffix it will open a tab automatically.

One option to close the tab is by clicking on the `x` next to `order_book`

Alternatively, you can remove the new tab by inputting the `order_book --close` command to close the tab
