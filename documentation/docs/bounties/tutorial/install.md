# Install Hummingbot

See below for installation guides for each supported platform. Note that we highlight the Docker-based installation path since it's easier for new users.

Advanced users who wish to install Hummingbot from source can find instructions in our main [Installation](/installation) section.

## Cloud Platforms

Because an active, stable network connection is ideal, we recommend that you run Hummingbot on a cloud provider if possible. In addition, running Hummingbot in the cloud may increase performance if you select servers in the same region as the exchanges on which you trade.
