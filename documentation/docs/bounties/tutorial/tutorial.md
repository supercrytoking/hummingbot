## Prerequisites
Below, we list all the preparation you need before you install and run Hummingbot. 

### System requirements
Make sure that your computer environment is up to date:

- (Linux) Ubuntu 16.04 or later
- (Mac) macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later
- (Windows) Windows 10 or later

If you want to install hummingbot from source and run locally, you need to install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/" target="_blank">Anaconda</a> since Hummingbot requires Python.

###ðŸ’° Token inventory 
You need to have enough inventory of the token pairs you want to trade. Be aware of the minimum order size requirements on different exchanges.

### Centralized exchange account and API 
In order to trade on a centralized exchange such as Binance, you will need to import its API key related credentials to Hummingbot. 

Instructions for how to find the API key for each exchange are below:

- [Binance](https://docs.hummingbot.io/connectors/binance/)
- [Coinbase Pro](https://docs.hummingbot.io/connectors/coinbase/)

### Ethereum wallet 

Hummingbot liquidity bounties will need your ethereum walletâ€™s public address for reward payouts. Also, users need to maintain 0.1 ETH in their wallet in order to prevent spam attacks. 

Follow the link [here](https://docs.hummingbot.io/installation/wallet/#creating-your-wallet) to create or import your wallet in Hummingbot.

!!! note "Note: Ethereum node"
    To trade on decentralized exchanges, you need to set up an Ethereum node in order to communicate with the blockchain. Read the instructions on [Ethereum node](https://docs.hummingbot.io/installation/node/).


## Installing hummingbot
Below are a few options for installing Hummingbot depending on your computer system and preference. In general, we recommend you install hummingbot in the cloud or from Docker. 

### Mac/Linux

With a pre-compiled version of `hummingbot` from Docker, you can easily [install Hummingbot](https://docs.hummingbot.io/installation/docker/) with just a few commands. In general, installing hummingbot from Docker takes less time than doing it from source. 

First, you need to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/#supported-platforms" target="_blank">download Docker</a>. It takes about one minute to download. Docker supports multiple operating platforms, cloud, and on-premises.

- Read [documentation](/installation/docker_macOS_linux) 

If you want to install hummingbot from source, here's how to -
- Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX57Q26LZcw&t=27s" target="_blank">step-by-step instruction video</a>
- Read [documentation](/installation/source/) 

### Windows

First, <a href="https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/"  target="_blank">download Docker</a> for Windows. Run the installation and restart if prompted. Open Docker using the **Quickstart Terminal** and create default configurations. 

- Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K67qN4nmSnw&list=PLDwlNkL_4MMczSzZiomX5wFFuF40z-KLl&index=5" target="_blank">step-by-step instruction video</a>
- Read [documentation](/installation/docker_windows) 


### Cloud
We highly recommend you unstall hummingbot in cloud platforms. Running hummingbot in the cloud saves your local computing power, memory, and storage, provides a stable and seamless connection that can keep the bot running 24/7, and increases the speed of transactions by operating on servers that are geographically closer to the exchanges. 

- Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdUshjOlP-8&list=PLDwlNkL_4MMczSzZiomX5wFFuF40z-KLl&index=5" target="_blank">instruction videos</a> for the cloud platform of your choice

## Running hummingbot
After all the installations are complete, you are now ready to configure your hummingbot and run it! The command line-based user interface should look something like the below image. 
![](https://www.hummingbot.io/blog/2019-04-announcing-hummingbot/hummingbot-cli.png)

The left bottom pane is where you enter [commands](https://docs.hummingbot.io/operation/client/#commands) to run the bot. The upper left pane prints the output of your commands and the right pane logs messages in real time. 


## Configuration
Every time you start running Hummingbot, you need to configure the settings. You can choose to `create` new settings or `import` previous config files. They can be [edited directly](https://docs.hummingbot.io/operation/configuration/) or accessed later in the `conf/` folder that hummingbot automactially creates when you first configure it. 

To participate in liquidity bounties, you should choose either **pure market making** strategy or **cross-exchange market making** startegy so that you can make market for designated tokens. The bounty rewards will be paid out based on the volume of your filled limit maker orders. 

### [Pure market making](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/pure-market-making/)

- Post buy and sell offers for an instrument on a single exchange, automatically adjust prices while actively managing inventory
- This strategy has a relatively higher risk and complexity as compared to the cross-exchange market making strategy and we ask users to exercise with caution

!!! note 
    To qualify for Harmony $ONE Makers at this moment, please choose **pure market making strategy** on **Binance** for any available $ONE token pairs.   

    **Learn how to configure your bot in order to be qualified for $ONE Makers, click [here](/bounties/tutorial/config).**

### [Cross-exchange market making](https://docs.hummingbot.io/strategies/cross-exchange-market-making/)	
    
- Also referred to as liquidity mirroring or exchange remarketing
- For this strategy, Hummingbot makes markets on smaller or less liquid exchanges and does the opposite, back-to-back transaction any filled trades on a more liquid exchange
- This strategy has relatively lower risk and complexity as compared to other market making strategies
