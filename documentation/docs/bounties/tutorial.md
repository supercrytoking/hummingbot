# Tutorial

This tutorial shows you how to install Hummingbot, register for Liquidity Bounties, and start earning rewards!

## Prerequisites
Below, we list what you'll need before you install and run Hummingbot. 

### System requirements

If you are installing Hummingbot on your local machine, below are the recommended minimum requirements:

- (Linux) Ubuntu 16.04 or later
- (Mac) macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later
- (Windows) Windows 10 or later

### Inventory of digital assets

Since market makers post offers to buy and sell an asset, they need some inventory in the exchange where they trade. You need inventory of both the **base asset** (the asset that you are buying and selling) and the **quote asset** (the asset that you exchange for it). 

For example, if you are making a market in the `BTC/USDT` trading pair on Binance, you'll need some `BTC` and `USDT`. In addition, be aware of the minimum order size requirements on different exchanges.

### Exchange API keys
In order to trade on a centralized exchange such as Binance, you will need to import its API keys into Hummingbot. 

For more information, please see [API Keys](/installation/api-keys).

### Ethereum wallet

Since bounty rewards are distributed to your Ethereum wallet, you'll need to enter your wallet's public address when you register. In addition, participants must maintain a balance of at least 0.1 ETH to be eligible to earn bounties. This mitigates the risk of spam attacks and ensures that everyone has a fair chances to earn the bounties.

For more information on creating or importing a wallet, see [Ethereum wallet](/installation/wallet).
