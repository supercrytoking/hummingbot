# Hummingbot liquidity bounties
Liquidity bounties are a community-based approach to market making. Inspired by bug bounties, liquidity bounties allow Hummingbot users to earn rewards from providing liquidity to a token project. 

Hummingbot is a free [open-source **software** client](https://www.hummingbot.io/whitepaper.pdf) that allows users to create and customize automated, algorithmic trading bots on both centralized and decentralized digital asset exchanges. Anyone who is eligible to trade the token can now compete with others to **earn extra rewards** based on their periodic trading activity. In addtion, participants can also see where they rank versus others via a **public leaderboard**.

We take compliance extremely seriously, because we want to reward only genuine providers of liquidity. For this reason, liquidity bounty participants need to opt into data collection, which allows us to attempt to verify their trading activity against our internal exchange data feeds. 

Liquidity bounties also enable token projects to leverage their native communities to act as liquidity providers across multiple exchanges. The program is designed to reward participants based on how much liquidity they provide in a given time period.
