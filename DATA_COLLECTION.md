# Important Disclosure re: Hummingbot Data Collection
 
Hummingbot (“Hummingbot”) is open-source software developed and maintained by CoinAlpha, Inc. (“CoinAlpha”, “we”, or “us”) and available at https://github.com/coinalpha/hummingbot.

CoinAlpha collects usage information from Users that have configured Hummingbot to allow for the sharing of this data.

## Purpose of data collection

### Software improvement

Data collected by CoinAlpha is used to help improve Hummingbot for all users.  It is important that our team understands the usage patterns and detects bugs as soon as possible, so we can best decide how to design future features and prioritize current work.

### Support

Users who provide data allow us to more easily diagnose problems, troubleshoot, and resolve any issues encountered when running Hummingbot.

### Incentive programs

CoinAlpha may administer incentive programs for itself or on behalf of third parties that provide rewards to Users based on their usage of Hummingbot.  In such cases, the data collected by CoinAlpha is required in order to confirm eligibility for participation and to enable participants to receive such rewards.

### Partnership compensation

CoinAlpha may receive compensation from partners (such as exchanges and incentive program partners) for Hummingbot-related software and services, requiring the collection of data to determine this compensation eligibility and amount.

## Types of data collected

The Usage Data that Hummingbot can collect and report to CoinAlpha are:

- Ethereum wallet address
- Orders created: base currency, quote currency, fees, price, and size
- Orders filled: base currency, quote currency, fees, price, and size
- Exchange
- Strategy names
- Commands entered in the client interface
- Log entries for errors, notifications, and trade events
- Client ID: a UUID generated by Hummingbot when first configured, which can also be manually entered by the User

Users can customize their logging settings to select which of this data, if any, they consent to sharing.

***Note***: *Users using Hummingbot for any [Liquidity Bounty Programs](https://hummingbot.io/liquidity-bounties/) may be subject to additional [data collection terms](https://hummingbot.io/liquidity-bounty-policy/).*

## Sensitive data

Hummingbot will never collect and/or report sensitive information, such as private keys, API keys, or passwords.

## How do I opt-out of data sharing or set what I am willing to share?

Users have the ability to fully customize the Usage Data that they are willing to share by setting the `hummingbot_logs.yml` file in the `logs/` folder.  We also provide templates ([logging configuration templates](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/templates/log_templates)) as examples of different levels of logging available to users.

If you still have questions about how to opt-out of or modify data collection, reach out to [support@hummingbot.io](mailto:support@hummingbot.io) and we will be happy to assist.

## How this data is used

When enabled by a user, data is reported by Hummingbot to CoinAlpha.  CoinAlpha uses its own systems as well as third parties (such as Datadog Inc.) to collect and process data.

Whenever there is a legitimate business purpose, CoinAlpha may share this data with partners, such as in the case of the incentive programs and partnership compensation discussed above.
