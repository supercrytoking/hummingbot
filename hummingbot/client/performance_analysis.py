        NOTE: This is not to say that base / quote pairs between different markets are equivalent because that is NOT
        the case. Instead, this method will determine the current conversion rate between two stable coins before
        adding the balance to the corresponding CurrencyAmount object. Additionally, since it is possible that the
        exchange rate varies from the starting time of the bot to the current time, this conversion will always be
        performed using the SAME conversion rate - that is, the current conversion rate.

        So for example, let's say we are trading WETH/DAI and ETH/USD. Let's also assume that in  the
        hummingbot_application class, the first MarketSymbolPair in the market_symbol_pair list is WETH/DAI. This means
        that in theory, the base and quote balances will be computed in terms of WETH and DAI, respectively. When the
        ETH and USD balances are added to those of WETH and DAI, the token conversion method - see
        erc.convert_token_value() will be called to convert the currencies using the CURRENT conversion rate. The
        current WETH/ETH conversion rate as well as the current DAI/USD conversion rates will be used for BOTH the
        starting and the current balance to ensure that any changes in the conversion rates while the bot was running
        do not affect the performance analysis feature."""
