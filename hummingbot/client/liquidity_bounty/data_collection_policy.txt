DATA MONITORING
It is the policy of CoinAlpha to monitor for and prohibit market manipulation and unlawful trading activities. Users are prohibited from using Hummingbot for purposes of market manipulation, including but not limited to wash trading, spoofing, pump-and-dump schemes or any other practices intended to mislead others by artificially affecting market activity.

In the course of providing the Services, CoinAlpha may monitor and detect “suspicious activity” in the form of potential market manipulation, including activity conducted by Hummingbot accounts that have opted-in to liquidity bounty programs and associated data collection. Based on any “suspicious activity" data, CoinAlpha may determine whether any additional steps are required, including reporting this activity to the Client, which may include the Sponsor or exchange(s). Throughout the process CoinAlpha may document when and how this monitoring is carried out and the rationale for handling the activity.

CoinAlpha reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to share user-provided information and analysis, and reports about potential market manipulation to the Sponsors. By participating in Bounty Programs, you consent to such sharing, acknowledge that it may have an impact on your accounts and activity, disclaim any potential liability against CoinAlpha or Hummingbot, and waive any potential claims against CoinAlpha or Hummingbot.
