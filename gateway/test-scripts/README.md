# gateway test scripts

Make sure to define your configuration settings in the [config file](../src/gateway-config.yml).
Then set the environment variable `ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` to your Ethereum private key that you
will use in testing. Start a local instance of the gateway API with `yarn start`, and run the 
test script with `yarn test-scripts`.
